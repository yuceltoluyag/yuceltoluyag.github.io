## Hello

As someone who smoked **one pack of cigarettes per day**, I want to share my experiences after switching to electronic cigarettes. First of all, I didn't purchase this device **consciously**; it was a journey that emerged completely from my friend's "Buy it, give it a try" suggestion.

## Why E-Cigarette?

After getting the device, I asked myself questions like "If I had quit smoking, would this product really help quit smoking? Would it be less expensive than cigarettes?" While seeking answers to these questions, I used myself as a **guinea pig**. Until the device came into my hands, I had no intention of **quitting smoking**.

## Smok NORD KIT

When my friend gave me this device, there were three 30ml nicotine-free liquids (totaling 90ml).

- Smok NORD KIT => 250 TL (at the time of purchase)
- 30ml liquid => 30 TL (average)
- Coil (5-pack) => 150 TL

| **Positives**                          | **Negatives**               |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1. Setup and usage quite easy          | 1. Low battery capacity     |
| 2. Portable                            | 2. Small tank capacity      |

## Using Smok NORD KIT

You need to be careful when carrying this device with you because its button is very sensitive. It can burn the coil while in your pocket. Despite putting it in a wide sweatshirt pocket, several of my coils got damaged this way. In my opinion, the actual purpose of this device is this: If you have a big e-cigarette at home (**Smok Alien 220 W, Vaporesso Revenger**, etc.), you carry this device with you outside for short-term tasks. By short-term, I mean the battery lasts about 2 hours. (Like a pacifier, it never leaves my mouth ðŸ˜Š) If you'll spend more time outside beyond this 2-hour period, it's better to bring your liquid and charging cable. Although websites say it charges in 45 minutes, my device takes 1-1.5 hours to charge. Thinking it might be from my charger and cable, I changed them too, but nothing changed. During this 2-hour period, if you use it constantly like me, you may need to refill the tank 2-3 times. This equals about 9ml.

## Did It Make Me Miss Cigarettes?

Friends, there are 3 types of liquid: nicotine-free, nicotine-containing and salt liquids. As someone who smoked one pack of cigarettes (Lark longs) a day, nicotine-free liquids will cost you more. So, don't start with nicotine-free liquids. I finished 90ml liquid in 5 days. During these 5 days, you can only satisfy your lip addiction. **90ml** liquid equals about **105 TL** at today's prices. During these 5 days I didn't miss cigarettes but I conditioned myself not to smoke. It's an experience aimed at hookah users. If you smoke hookah, you can prefer nicotine-free flavors.

## Usage Recommendations

First of all, you can start with 3mg nicotine liquids. Nicotine is not a harmless substance, it's harmful when burned. Electronic cigarette users or sellers generally hide behind this sentence. Yes, unlike cigarettes, it doesn't have unknown poisons and tar inside, but nicotine itself is harmful enough. So what's the difference? As a Lark long smoker, there's **0.8 mg Nicotine, 10 mg Tar, 10 mg Carbon Monoxide** in one Lark long. Assuming you finish a **30ml** bottle in **5-7 days**, you'll be like smoking **one pack** of cigarettes per week. (There's no carbon monoxide or tar in e-cigarettes.)

If 3mg doesn't cut it, you can try 6mg or 9mg. If 9mg doesn't cut it either, you can turn to salt liquids. :) While it's completely your personal preference, it's better to make calculations like above.

## Expenses

After the initial expenses, I order 60ml instead of 30ml so I don't have to constantly send orders. Two of them last me 15-20 days. I use them constantly. A 5-pack coil lasts 5-6 months if used properly. The life of one coil is about 1 month, and can reach 1.5 months depending on your usage. You have no other expenses. So your maximum monthly expense is 260 TL. 4 x 65 = 130 (60mg liquid is 65 TL).

## A Tactic

Let's say your **last coil** is about to finish its life or burned out, you ordered and are waiting for it to arrive. You can put that coil in hot water, then dry it. In this way, you can manage for 1-2 days. (Don't inhale hard ðŸ˜Š) Your package should arrive during this time.

- When buying these kinds of products, don't write things like "e-cigarette purchase, liquid or coil purchase" in wire transfers. You can't trade with anyone. This didn't happen to me, but I researched like those who read this article. Even though websites selling the products have it written in big letters, they can make ridiculous statements like "They didn't send my product, they didn't return my full money" (Only EFT fee is deducted, there's no significant deduction.)

- Pay attention to the websites you shop from.

- When switching to a different liquid flavor, definitely clean and dry your tank well with hot water, otherwise flavors will mix and you won't understand anything.

## Flavors I Used

[responsive_img src="/images/esigara-yararlimi-zararlimi-xl.webp" alt="Manhattan Liquid" /]

As can be understood from the image, I use Manhattan liquids. The ones I use frequently:

1. Magic Moonlight
2. City Night
3. Casablanca Night (Recommended for those starting to quit smoking)

The site related, automatically connected the software. Place your order, lean back ðŸ˜Š They send 5ml different flavors for you to try.

## Conclusion

I think it helps quit smoking. If you're a heavy smoker, you can start from the 9mg nicotine level and gradually transition to nicotine-free. Unlike cigarettes, it doesn't cause tiredness or laziness feelings. Most importantly, the liquids you use smell very nice; there's no longer the bad smell of cigarettes. There are no situations like the burning in your throat or bad smell in your mouth when you wake up in the mornings. As for why this is banned, I don't know, I can't figure it out either... ðŸ˜„

!!! danger "Important Dosage Information; Remember that the above pack calculation is invalid with 6mg, 9mg nicotine levels since the nicotine ratio increases. I'm someone who smokes Lark and Red Winston. 3mg nicotine liquids were sufficient for me. If you smoke coal, anything below salt liquid won't save you. ðŸ˜Š So there's no point in exaggerating, I don't recommend approaching salt liquids. Try and see for yourself. Start with 3mg, gradually decrease... Be human, just a little bit! ðŸ˜„"

## Damages

It causes dry mouth, so you drink plenty of water. You might fart in unexpected places ðŸ˜Š I didn't see anything else wrong with it. As I said, this device can really help quit smoking. It's been two months since I started using it, I never missed cigarettes. Once I thought about lighting one up, it smelled like trash and tasted very sour, so I immediately put it out.

!!! danger "Health Warning; Friends, consult your doctor before using. If your teeth are sensitive or you have palate problems, don't get excited by my article and try to use it. After all, you're giving heat to your mouth. Also definitely use quality liquids when using; there are so many low-quality liquids in the market that while trying to quit smoking, you might get sick from somewhere else..."

## Season Finale

If I carry it with me, smoke a lot, I can't deal with its charging and tank constantly, then I recommend you to turn to models with bigger battery and tank. Due to dollar exchange rate and increasing bans, it's a bit difficult to find these types of devices. Quality and usable new devices start from 700 TL. You can buy second-hand if you can find one. After all, you can clean and use the part that touches your mouth (if you want, you can buy this part new) and tank with vinegar water. Currently in this sector, tablet-style (Juul) types are popular, demand for combustion ones is gradually decreasing. If you're going to start e-cigarettes and have crazy questions in mind, leave a comment, I'll try to help as much as I know.

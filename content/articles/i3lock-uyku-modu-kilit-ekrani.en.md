## How to Set Automatic Lock Screen When Waking from Sleep Mode with i3lock?

If you're using Linux and want your screen to automatically lock when your computer wakes from sleep mode, you're in the right place. In this guide, I'll explain how to do this with the popular screen locker **i3lock** (specifically `i3lock-color`).

Security is important, especially when you leave your computer unattended even for a short time. Here's the solution: an automatic screen lock system that works with `systemd`. üëá

## üì¶ Preparation: Disable Unnecessary Screen Lockers

The first step is to prevent automatic activation of existing screen lockers on your system. I'm using the **KDE** desktop environment (on Arch Linux), so I configured the **KScreenLocker** settings as follows:

‚ö†Ô∏è _Make sure options like "Automatically lock" and "lock when resuming" are not checked._

Then make sure `i3lock` is installed on your system. My recommendation: prefer [i3lock-color](https://github.com/Raymo111/i3lock-color){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. It provides more customization options.

## For Arch-based systems

```bash
yay -S i3lock-color # For Arch-based systems
```

## For Debian-based systems

```bash
sudo apt install autoconf gcc make pkg-config libpam0g-dev libcairo2-dev libfontconfig1-dev libxcb-composite0-dev libev-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-image0-dev libxcb-util0-dev libxcb-xrm-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev
```

## Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install -y autoconf automake cairo-devel fontconfig gcc libev-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel libXinerama libxkbcommon-devel libxkbcommon-x11-devel libXrandr pam-devel pkgconf xcb-util-image-devel xcb-util-xrm-devel
```

20.04 LTS$/20.04 LTS

```bash
sudo apt install autoconf gcc make pkg-config libpam0g-dev libcairo2-dev libfontconfig1-dev libxcb-composite0-dev libev-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-image0-dev libxcb-util-dev libxcb-xrm-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libjpeg-dev
```

## üîê Step 1: Create Lock Script

First, let's create a bash script containing the screen locking commands:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/scripts
nano ~/scripts/i3lock.sh
```

The content will be like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
i3lock # With parameters you want to use. You can see options with i3lock -h
```

Save the file and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/scripts/i3lock.sh
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Define systemd Service

Now, we'll create a `systemd` service that will automatically run the above script when exiting sleep mode.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/wakelock@.service
```

And paste the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Lock screen when exiting sleep mode
Before=sleep.target suspend.target

[Service]
User=%i
Type=forking
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
ExecStart=/home/%i/scripts/i3lock.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=sleep.target suspend.target
```

This configuration identifies the X session with the `DISPLAY=:0` definition and runs the script for the specified user.

## üöÄ Step 3: Enable Service

Use the following command to enable and immediately start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable wakelock@<YOUR_USERNAME> --now
```

> Don't forget to write your own username instead of . Example:
> `sudo systemctl enable wakelock@yucel --now`

After this, whenever your system returns from sleep mode, the `i3lock` screen locker will automatically activate. üîí

## üîÅ How to Apply Configuration Updates?

If you made changes in the script or service file, you don't need to restart the entire system. Restarting the service with the following command is sufficient:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wakelock@<YOUR_USERNAME>
```

## üìù Conclusion

In this article, you learned a practical way to make your Linux system more secure with i3lock and systemd. With a minimal but effective configuration, you can have your screen automatically lock when your computer wakes from sleep mode. Such security measures are particularly important on portable devices.

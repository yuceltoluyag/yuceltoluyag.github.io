## 🚀 Introduction

When trying to install [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} on a Debian-based server, you may encounter the "`Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend`" error. This error usually occurs due to another `apt` process running on the system and interrupts the installation.

In this article, we will explain step by step why this error occurs, how to detect it and how to solve it safely. ✅

## 🧠 Meaning of the Error

The error message usually appears as follows:

```bash
E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend. It is held by process 1241 (apt)
```

This means that another `apt` process running on the system has locked the `dpkg` system and therefore your process is blocked.

---

## 🔍 Step by Step Solution

### 1. Check active `apt` processes:

```bash
ps aux | grep apt
```

This command lists running or frozen `apt` processes. For example:

```bash
root  1241  0.3  apt upgrade -y
```

### 2. Terminate these processes if necessary ⚠️

```bash
sudo kill -9 1241 1240 1239
```

### 3. Clean lock files 🧹

```bash
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
```

### 4. Fix `dpkg` configuration 🛠️

```bash
sudo dpkg --configure -a
```

### 5. Update package lists and complete missing items 📦

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

### 6. Install the required package (example: `libtext-iconv-perl`)

```bash
sudo apt install libtext-iconv-perl
```

### 7. Restart YunoHost installation 🌐

```bash
curl https://install.yunohost.org | bash
```

## ✅ Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to solve the `dpkg lock` error that frequently occurs during the YunoHost installation process. This method works not only for YunoHost, but also for all `apt`-based installations in general.

🔒 Locked systems can be demoralizing, but you can quickly solve them with these steps!

## 📚 Extra Tips

- If `apt` processes frequently freeze, check your server's disk space.
- You can monitor general resource usage on the system with the `htop` command.
- For long installation processes, you can use `tmux` or `screen` to prevent SSH sessions from disconnecting.

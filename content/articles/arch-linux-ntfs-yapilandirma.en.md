## What is the Problem? ‚ö†Ô∏è

Since Linux's default file system is **ext** (ext1, ext2, ext3, ext4), when setting up a new system, you may encounter the error **"failed to mount diskadƒ± -> not authorized to perform operation"** when trying to mount NTFS formatted disks. If you're using a more modern file manager, it might also ask for a **password** when you try to connect. Linux recognizes other file systems but requires authorization to perform operations.

## Solution 1Ô∏è‚É£: Authorization Settings

Open the terminal and install the following packages:

```bash
sudo pacman -S gvfs ntfs-3g dosfstools
```

Then, follow these steps:

```bash
su
cd /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d
touch 10-drives.rules
vim 10-drives.rules  # You can also use Nano or another editor
```

Add the following code to the opened file:

```javascript
polkit.addRule(function (action, subject) {
  if (action.id.indexOf("org.freedesktop.udisks2.") == 0) {
    return polkit.Result.YES;
  }
});
```

If these settings don't take effect on your system, you can try running the update again with the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S gvfs ntfs-3g dosfstools
```

Finally, add the user to the **disk** group:

```bash
sudo gpasswd -a $USER disk
```

After restarting your computer, the problem will be solved. üöÄ

## Alternative Solution 2Ô∏è‚É£: Manual Mounting

To see the list of connected disks and their UUID information, you can run the following command:

```bash
sudo blkid
```

To mount an NTFS disk to a specific folder:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/ntfsdisk
```

```bash
sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdXX /mnt/ntfsdisk
```

!!! tip "For the <b>sdXX</b> disk name, write the disk name you found with the `blkid` command (for example: sda1, sdb2, etc.)."

If you want to unmount the disk:

```bash
sudo umount /mnt/ntfsdisk
```

---

## Automatic Mounting of Disk üîÑ

If you want the disk to be automatically mounted at startup, you need to edit your **fstab** file:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/fstab  # You can also use Nano or another editor
```

Add the following line at the bottom of the file:

```
/dev/sdXX /mnt/ntfsdisk ntfs-3g uid=username,gid=users,umask=0022 0 0
```

When you restart your computer, the disk will be automatically mounted. üöÄ

## Why Should You Use `.xprofile` If You're Using LightDM?

Are you editing the `~/.xinitrc` file to start your desktop environment in Arch Linux or other Linux distributions, but nothing works? ðŸ¤”  
There could be only one reason: **You're using LightDM or a similar Display Manager and your `.xinitrc` file is useless!** In this article, we'll examine the difference between `.xinitrc` and `.xprofile` in detail and show you step by step why you should use `.xprofile`.

## What are `.xinitrc` and `.xprofile`?

### What Does the `.xinitrc` File Do?

`.xinitrc` traditionally enters into action when the desktop environment is started with the **`startx` command**. It's usually used in the following situations:

- Users who manually start sessions via `tty`
- Light systems (not using Display Manager)
- Minimalist users who want full control

Example `.xinitrc` content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr &
exec i3
```

### What is the `.xprofile` File Used For?

`.xprofile` is run by **Display Managers that automatically start GUI sessions**. It's used especially for the following:

* Systems using display managers like `lightdm`, `gdm`, `sddm`
* Environment variables (`PATH`, `XCURSOR_PATH`), session startup applications (`numlockx`, `dunst`, etc.)
* Background services (like `mpd`, `ssh-agent`)

---

## Why Does LightDM Ignore `.xinitrc`?

Display Managers (especially LightDM):

* Start sessions by themselves
* Don't **run** `~/.xinitrc`
* Only look at files like `~/.xprofile`, `~/.xsession`, `~/.pam_environment`

So, no matter what you write in `.xinitrc`, **LightDM won't read it**.
Therefore, you must move all commands you want to run at startup to `.xprofile`.

---

## Practical Scenario: Correct Startup with `.xprofile`

The following example `.xprofile` file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Environment variables
export XCURSOR_PATH="$HOME/.local/share/icons:$HOME/.icons:/usr/share/icons"

# Background services
pgrep -x "mpd" > /dev/null || setsid mpd &
setsid xscreensaver &
setsid dunst &

# SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" 2>/dev/null || true

# Nvidia settings
nvidia-settings --load-config-only --config "$HOME/.config/.nvidia-settings-rc" &

# i3 window manager
exec dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session i3
```

As long as you keep the above commands in `.xinitrc`, nothing will happen. But if you put them in `.xprofile`, everything will work like magic! ðŸª„

## Step by Step Transition: `.xinitrc` â†’ `.xprofile`

1. Analyze `.xinitrc` content
2. Move environment variables and service startups to `.xprofile`
3. Write `exec` commands only once (don't make nested calls)
4. Clean or delete `.xinitrc` file (optional)

---

## Common Mistakes

* Doing `source ~/.xinitrc` in `.xprofile` and writing `exec i3` again in `xinitrc` â†’ **Double startup error**
* Writing only `export` commands in `.xinitrc` â†’ **Nothing will run**
* Not making `.xprofile` executable â†’ `chmod +x ~/.xprofile`

## Summary: Which File Should You Use When?

| Situation                           | Correct File        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| If you're logging in with `startx`   | `.xinitrc`         |
| If there's a DM like LightDM       | `.xprofile`        |
| System-wide environment variables | `/etc/environment` |

---

## Conclusion and Call: Do You Know Which One to Use?

Now you know the differences between `.xinitrc` and `.xprofile`. If you're using a Display Manager, move all your startup commands to your **`.xprofile`** file.
This way, you'll be free from troubles like services that can't start, theme settings that don't work, missing icons, etc.!

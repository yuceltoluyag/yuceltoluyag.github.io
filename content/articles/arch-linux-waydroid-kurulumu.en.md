## Introduction

If you want to **install Waydroid on Arch Linux**, you're in the right place. In this guide, we will show you step by step what Waydroid is, which packages are required, how to load system modules, and how to run Waydroid for the first time.

Waydroid is a project that allows you to run Android applications in a **container** on Linux. It runs the Android environment directly over **LXC (Linux Containers)** on your system without installing a virtual machine. This way, you get a much faster, integrated, and resource-friendly Android experience ‚ö°

At the end of this guide:

- You will be able to install Waydroid on Arch Linux from scratch,
- You will learn how to enable binder modules,
- You will manage Waydroid system services,
- You will be able to start Android applications on your desktop smoothly,
- You will be able to optimize the gaming experience with advanced features.

## What is Waydroid?

**Waydroid** is an open-source tool designed to run Android applications on Linux systems.
Simply put:

> It runs the Android operating system in an isolated environment directly on the Linux kernel without closing system resources to a virtual machine.

Waydroid uses **LXC** based container technology. Thanks to this:

- Performance is much higher than virtual machines,
- Hardware acceleration can be used,
- System resources are shared efficiently.

### Basic Components

| Component            | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **waydroid**         | Main command line tool                    |
| **binder_linux**     | Provides Android binder interface         |
| **ashmem_linux**     | Android shared memory module              |
| **systemd services** | Automatically starts Waydroid's container |

## Step 1: Installing Required Packages

First, let's install Waydroid and required modules on your system.
For Arch Linux users, using `pacman` and `yay` is the easiest method.

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu lxc python-gbinder
yay -S waydroid
```

!!! tip "If `yay` is not installed üí°"
To install the `yay` helper tool:

```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

---

## Step 2: Enabling Binder and Ashmem Modules

For Waydroid to communicate with Android components, the **binder** and **ashmem** modules must be active.

```bash
lsmod | grep binder
lsmod | grep ashmem
```

If there is no output:

```bash
sudo modprobe binder_linux
sudo modprobe ashmem_linux
```

!!! note "To make permanent ‚ö° If you want to load modules automatically at each restart:"

```bash
echo -e "binder_linux\nashmem_linux" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/waydroid.conf
```

---

## Step 3: Enabling Waydroid Services

Waydroid uses two main services on the system:

- `waydroid-container.service`
- `waydroid-session.service`

To enable services:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now waydroid-container.service
```

Check status:

```bash
systemctl status waydroid-container.service
```

!!! tip "If binder module is not active, service cannot start ‚ö° You can check with `dmesg | grep binder`."

---

## Step 4: Starting Waydroid Environment

Start the Waydroid container:

```bash
sudo waydroid init
```

The initial installation may take a few minutes.
After installation is complete:

```bash
waydroid session start
waydroid show-full-ui
```

!!! tip "If you use Wayland or GNOME Shell üí° The `waydroid show-full-ui` command opens the Android interface on the desktop."

---

## Step 5: Application Management

### Application List

```bash
waydroid app list
```

### Launch Application

```bash
waydroid app launch com.android.settings
```

### Install Application

```bash
waydroid app install ~/Downloads/application.apk
```

!!! note "Some APKs may not work ‚ö° Applications requiring Google services do not work without GApps."

---

## Step 6: Stopping Waydroid

```bash
waydroid session stop
sudo systemctl stop waydroid-container.service
```

---

## Step 7: Troubleshooting

### Waydroid Logs

```bash
waydroid log
```

### If Binder Module is Not Loaded

```bash
sudo modprobe binder_linux
sudo systemctl restart waydroid-container.service
```

!!! warning "If you get No binder devices found error ‚ö†Ô∏è Install a custom kernel if necessary."

---

## Step 8: Advanced Settings and Gaming Experience ‚öôÔ∏è

### 8.1 Fake Wi-Fi

```bash
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.fake_wifi "com.lilithgame.roc.gp"
```

!!! tip "Provides fake Wi-Fi for specific applications üí°"

### 8.2 Udev and Uevent

```bash
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.udev true
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.uevent true
```

!!! note "Forwards Linux hardware events to Android side ‚ö°"

### 8.3 Gamepad Support üéÆ

After connecting the control device, it is automatically recognized by Android.
If there are problems, check the `/dev/input` directory.

### 8.4 XTR KeyMapper

```bash
sh /sdcard/Android/data/xtr.keymapper/files/xtMapper.sh
```

or

```bash
/system/bin/app_process -Djava.library.path=$(echo /data/app/*/xtr.keymapper*/lib/x86_64) \
-Djava.class.path=$(echo /data/app/*/xtr.keymapper*/base.apk) / xtr.keymapper.server.RemoteServiceShell
```

!!! tip "Manually starts key mappings üí°"

### 8.5 Memory Management

```bash
sudo systemctl stop waydroid-container
```

!!! warning "Stops container and frees memory ‚ö†Ô∏è"

### 8.6 Initial Start

```bash
sudo systemctl start waydroid-container
```

In subsequent sessions:

```bash
waydroid session start
```

## Conclusion üéØ

Now **Waydroid installation and advanced settings on Arch Linux** are complete!
You can get an optimized experience with Android games, gamepad, fake Wi-Fi, and key mappings.

!!! tip "Advanced setting üí° With `waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.debug_shell true` you can see live Android shell errors."

## Composer Slow Download Issues and Solutions ⚡

Have you noticed packages downloading slowly when using Composer? Don't worry! You can increase your speed using the methods below. 💨

```bash
composer diagnose
Checking platform settings: OK
Checking git settings: OK
Checking http connectivity to packagist: OK
Checking https connectivity to packagist: OK
Checking github.com rate limit: 1 OK
Checking disk free space: OK
Checking pubkeys: FAIL Missing pubkey for tags verification
Missing pubkey for dev verification
Run composer self-update --update-keys to set them up Checking composer version: OK
Composer version: 1.9.1 PHP version: 7.4.0 PHP binary path: /usr/bin/php
```


### 1️⃣ Diagnosing the Issue: `composer diagnose`

First, run the following command to detect current issues:

```bash
composer diagnose
```

If you get an error message like below, Composer might need updated `public key`s:

```bash
Checking pubkeys: FAIL Missing pubkey for tags verification
Missing pubkey for dev verification
Run composer self-update --update-keys to set them up
```

To solve this issue:

```bash
composer self-update --update-keys
```

Alternatively, go to the `~/.config/composer/` directory and create the following two files, then add the updated keys from the [Composer Public Key](https://composer.github.io/pubkeys.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} page:

- `keys.dev.pub`
- `keys.tags.pub`

Then close and reopen your terminal and run the `composer diagnose` command again. ✅



### 2️⃣ IPv6 Issue and Solution 🌍

In some networks, IPv6 connections may cause timeouts. If your Composer operations take longer than expected, try disabling IPv6:

```bash
sudo sh -c "echo 'precedence ::ffff:0:0/96 100' >> /etc/gai.conf"
```

After performing this operation, test Composer again. 🚀



### 3️⃣ Updating Composer Package Source 🔄

By default, Composer works through `packagist.org`. If your connection is slow, you can update the `packagist` address with the following command:

```bash
composer config --global repo.packagist composer https://packagist.org
```

This operation can enable packages to load faster. 🔥



### 4️⃣ Using Parallel Download ⏩

To speed up Composer operations, you can install the `prestissimo` plugin. This plugin enables packages to be downloaded simultaneously:

```bash
composer global require hirak/prestissimo
```

However, remember that `prestissimo` has become unnecessary in Composer 2.0 and later versions. If you are using Composer 1.x, you can try this method. 😉



### 5️⃣ In-depth Debugging 🕵️‍♂️

To see what Composer is doing in detail, you can use the following commands:

```bash
composer -vvv require phpunit/phpunit
```

This command will show downloaded files and network connections in detail. If you notice any problems, you can apply the above solutions according to the error messages. 🛠️



## Conclusion 🎯

Slow download issues with Composer can be frustrating, but you can gain significant speed by applying the methods above. In summary:

✅ Check errors with `composer diagnose`
✅ Turn off IPv6 connection
✅ Update Packagist address
✅ Use parallel download plugin
✅ Perform detailed debugging

I hope this guide makes your Composer usage more enjoyable! 🎉

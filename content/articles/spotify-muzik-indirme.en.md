## Why?

Hello! **Spotify** only offers the offline music listening feature to **premium** subscribers. However, in this guide, I will show you step by step how to download your favorite playlists for free without using a premium account.

There are various **Spotify downloader** tools available on the internet, but most of them either don't work properly or can't provide continuity. The method I will explain has been working flawlessly for months and is very practical!

## How to Do It?

1. **Log into your Spotify account** and visit the following site:

2. **Click on the Spotify tab** and then press the **"Login with Spotify"** button to log into your account.

   _The duration of the process may vary depending on the length of the playlist._

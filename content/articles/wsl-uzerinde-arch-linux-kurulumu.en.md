## **Hello**

Those who follow my stories on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yuceltoluyag/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} were asking how I installed **Arch Linux** on **WSL**. Those who managed to install it were complaining that it **kept crashing**. I've been using it for a long time. I haven't experienced any crashes, breakdowns, burns or anything similar. üòé

## What is WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux)?

It allows us to run Linux under Windows without third-party software. What's the difference between **WSL 1** and **WSL 2**? Because **Hyper-V** technology is used in **WSL 2**, it works more **performantly**. Although graphical (**Desktop**) interface is not officially supported yet, many users are installing and using it with **DE** included. I definitely **recommend** it to friends who spend their **lifetime** in the **Linux** community ü§©

| Feature | WSL 1 | WSL 2 |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Integration between Windows and Linux | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Fast boot times | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Small resource footprint compared to traditional Virtual Machines | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Works with current versions of VMware and VirtualBox | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Virtual Machine Management | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Full Linux Kernel | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Full system call compatibility | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Performance on OS file systems | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |

## Ingredients ü•ó

- Your Windows 10 version for WSL 2 should be **2004** or **higher** (**19041**) or you should be using **Windows 11**. You can quickly find out your version like this. Press `Windows + R`, type `winver` in the screen that appears, it will show you your version number.

## WSL2 Installation

Start your terminal **as Administrator**. And enter the following command.

```bash

wsl --install

```

output

```bash

Installing: Virtual Machine Platform

Virtual Machine Platform has been installed.

Installing: Windows Subsystem for Linux

Windows Subsystem for Linux has been installed.

Downloading: WSL Kernel

Installing: WSL Kernel

WSL Kernel has been installed.

Downloading: Ubuntu

The requested operation was successful. Changes will not be effective until the system is rebooted.

```

Then **restart the system** üëÄ After your computer **restarts**, the **WSL2** **kernel update** package and **Ubuntu Linux** distribution will be installed **automatically**. The installation time will vary depending on your internet speed. Don't worry about freezing and close the **terminal** ü§°

After the installation is complete, it will ask you to create a **username** and **password**. Fill in those sections.


[responsive_img src="/images/wls-archlinux-kurulumu2-xl.webp" alt="wsl2-archlinux-installation2" /]
```bash

Enter new UNIX username: enterusername

New password:Enter Password

Retype new password: Re-enter Your Password

```

output

```bash

Installing, this may take a few minutes...

Please create a default UNIX user account. The username does not need to match your Windows username.

For more information visit: https://aka.ms/wslusers

Enter new UNIX username: friday13

New password:

Retype new password:

passwd: password updated successfully

Installation successful!

To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".

See "man sudo_root" for details.

Our WSL installation is complete up to this point. Now you can see the **Ubuntu** distribution in your **terminal** tab.


[responsive_img src="/images/wls-archlinux-kurulumu3-xl.webp" alt="wsl2-archlinux-installation3" /]

As usual, let's update our ubuntu ü§≠

```bash

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

```

## Archlinux Installation

- Run the `wsl --set-default-version 2` command. Some users can do this by skipping the above parts üòè If you're curious about which **WSL** version your system is using

```bash

wsl -l -v

```

output

```bash

NAME STATE VERSION

* Ubuntu Running 2

```

type the command to see which **distro** is using which version.

- Go to the [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL/releases){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} repository and download the latest version. (Arch.zip)

- Create a folder named `archlinux` under the `C` directory.

- Extract the file you downloaded from the zip. Copy the two files named `Arch.exe` and `rootfs.tar.gz` inside it and paste them into the `C:\archlinux` folder.

- Run Archlinux.exe.


[responsive_img src="/images/wls-archlinux-kurulumu4-xl.webp" alt="wsl2-archlinux-installation4" /]
- After the installation is complete, start **Arch Linux** from your terminal.


[responsive_img src="/images/wls-archlinux-kurulumu5-xl.webp" alt="wsl2-archlinux-installation5" /]
- Let's create a user immediately and give ourselves sudo privileges ü§ñ **Friday13** is my native and national nickname. You can write **ali** or **mehmet** there, write whatever you want ‚ò†Ô∏è

```bash

useradd -m -g users -G optical,storage,wheel,video,audio,users,power,network,log -s /bin/bash friday13 #ENTER THE USERNAME YOU WILL CREATE#

```

```bash

passwd friday13 #set the password for the user you created.#

```

```bash

groupadd sudo #let's add sudo group#

```

```bash

nano /etc/sudoers

```

we open our file and add the user we created as shown in the picture.

```bash

%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:

%sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL

```


[responsive_img src="/images/wls-archlinux-kurulumu6-xl.webp" alt="wsl2-archlinux-installation6" /]
We are **removing** the **hash (#)** signs at the beginning of these lines. Press **F3** then **enter** and **F2** to exit.

- To activate the user we created as default when the system starts

(**Warning** you will enter these commands **not** in the **Arch** terminal, but in the **normal terminal**. üéÉ)

```bash

cd C:\archlinux #go to directory

Arch.exe config --default-user friday13

```


[responsive_img src="/images/wls-archlinux-kurulumu7-xl.webp" alt="wsl2-archlinux-installation7" /]

Then **close** all open terminals and **open** them again, select **Arch** from the **Arch** tab. Tada :)


[responsive_img src="/images/wls-archlinux-kurulumu8-xl.webp" alt="wsl2-archlinux-installation8" /]
After that, I don't know if you run horses or make camels jump over ditches : ) Hang out as you please.

## How to Import Your Local Files.

If you want to import your existing files into **Arch**. Press `Windows + R` keys, type `\\wsl$`, now you're in the file directory ü§ô

## RAM and CPU Management

- List the operating systems running **active** on the system with this command. üë®‚Äçüíª

```bash

wsl --list --verbose

```

- Then we **shutdown** **WSL**.

```bash

wsl --shutdown

```

- Go to your user directory `C:\Users\<YourUsername>` and **create** a file named `.wslconfig`. And **fill** the inside of the file like this:

```bash

# Settings apply to all Linux distributions running on WSL 2

# You can see RAM memory in wsl2 with "free -m".

[wsl2]



# Limits VM memory to use maximum 12 GB, by default 50% of RAM

memory=12GB



# Sets VM to use 8 virtual processors (Adjust according to your core count)

processors=4



# Sets swap storage amount to 4 GB, by default 25% of available RAM

# You can write 0 if you don't want to use it.

swap=4GB



```

Don't forget to **change** these settings according to your system specifications..

## Packages and Customization

- I edited my `/etc/pacman.conf` file.

- `sudo pacman -S git openssh base base-devel wget htop neovim curl ruby nodejs python` I installed the basic need packages.

- When you see this warning while installing packages

```bash
fakeroot is in IgnorePkg/IgnoreGroup. Install anyway? [Y/n] n\*\*
```

**definitely don't remove it** keep it in mind. Whenever you see it, **press n** üêß

- I installed **YAY** package manager

```bash

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git

cd yay-git/

makepkg -sri

cd ..

rm -rf yay-git/

yay -Syyu

```

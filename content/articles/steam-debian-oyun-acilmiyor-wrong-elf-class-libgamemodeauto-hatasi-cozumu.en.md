For Linux users, Steam is the indispensable gateway to the gaming world. However, when trying to open games on Debian, you may encounter **"wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32/64"**, **"libgamemodeauto.so preload cannot be preloaded"** or **FMOD preload errors**.

[responsive_img src="/images/steam-debian-wrong-elf-class-gamemode-hatasi-xl.webp" alt="Steam Debian Wrong ELF Class and Gamemode Error Solution" /]

These problems are usually related to **missing 32-bit libraries**, **GameMode package incompatibility** or **Steam Overlay preload issues**.

In this article, we will cover **two different methods** to solve the problem of Steam games not opening on Debian:

1. Installing missing packages via repository
2. Manual GameMode installation with `.deb` packages
3. Alternative solutions for FMOD and LD_PRELOAD errors

If you're ready, let's move on to the step-by-step solutions. üöÄ

---

## üîç Symptoms of the Problem

- Steam opens normally, the game starts but **closes instantly**.
- The following errors are seen in terminal output:

```bash

  ERROR: ld.so: object '/home/user/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/gameoverlayrenderer.so'
  from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32): ignored.

  ERROR: ld.so: object 'libgamemodeauto.so.0' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.

```

- FMOD errors in some games:

```bash
  ERROR: ld.so: object '.../libfmodstudio.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.
```

!!! note "These errors usually prevent the game from running. However, the solution is simple: install missing libraries and correct GameMode packages."

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Method 1: Installing Missing Packages via Repository

Missing 32-bit libraries are the most common cause of the problem on Debian.

### 1. Enable 32-bit architecture

```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
```

### 2. Install Mesa and Vulkan libraries

```bash
sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers mesa-vulkan-drivers:i386 \
                 libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 \
                 libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-glx:i386
```

### 3. Install GameMode package

```bash
sudo apt install gamemode libgamemode0:i386
```

---

### üîß If Problem Continues: LD_PRELOAD Test Method

If the game still doesn't open after the above steps, test with the following command in terminal:

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libgamemode.so.0"
steam
```

Start Steam from terminal this way and try the game. If it works, you can add this line to **Steam launcher settings** or `~/.bashrc` file.

!!! tip "This method is for testing purposes only. For permanent solution, manual GameMode installation (Method 2) is healthier."

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Method 2: Manual GameMode Installation with `.deb` Packages

In some cases, GameMode packages in Debian repositories may be incompatible. In this case, you can download and manually install updated `.deb` files from **Debian Sid** repository.

### 1. Remove existing GameMode package

```bash
sudo apt remove gamemode --autoremove
```

### 2. Download required `.deb` files

- [gamemode (amd64)](https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/gamemode/download)
- [gamemode-daemon (amd64)](https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/gamemode-daemon/download)
- [libgamemode0 (amd64)](https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/libgamemode0/download)
- [libgamemodeauto0 (amd64)](https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/libgamemodeauto0/download)
- [libgamemode0 (i386)](https://packages.debian.org/sid/i386/libgamemode0/download)
- [libgamemodeauto0 (i386)](https://packages.debian.org/sid/i386/libgamemodeauto0/download)

### 3. Install downloaded packages

```bash
sudo apt install -f ./gamemode.deb ./gamemode-daemon.deb \
./libgamemode0.deb ./libgamemodeauto0.deb \
./libgamemode0_i386.deb ./libgamemodeauto0_i386.deb
```

## üí° Additional Tips

### üéµ FMOD Error (libfmodstudio.so preload)

You may get the following error in some games:

```
ERROR: ld.so: object '.../libfmodstudio.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.
```

This is generally **not critical**. It occurs because Steam Overlay or FMOD libraries are trying to preload in the wrong architecture.

To be sure, check FMOD libraries in game directory:

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/WW1GameSeries/Tannenberg/Tannenberg_Data/Plugins/
ls -lh libfmod*
```

### Using Proton

Right-click on game in Steam ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Compatibility ‚Üí Select Proton 9.0-2 and try.

### Testing Theme Issues

GTK themes can sometimes cause errors. Test with Adwaita theme:

```bash
sudo apt install adwaita-gtk2-theme adwaita-icon-theme
```

## ‚úÖ Conclusion and Summary

**Wrong ELF class**, **libgamemodeauto preload** and **FMOD preload** errors that prevent Steam games from opening on Debian largely stem from missing libraries.

We learned three-stage solutions in this guide:

1. Installing missing 32-bit packages and GameMode from repository
2. Testing with LD_PRELOAD method
3. Manually downloading and reinstalling GameMode with updated `.deb` packages

Both methods solve the problem, but **the first is more practical**, while the second offers a **more up-to-date** alternative.

Now you can run Steam games seamlessly on Debian. üéÆüêß

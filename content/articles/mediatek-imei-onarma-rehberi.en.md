## üõ†Ô∏è Step by Step IMEI Repair Process

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step: Installing Required Tools

First, download the mtk_imei tool from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timjosten/mtk_imei.git
cd mtk_imei
```

!!! tip "Don't run the script yet, we need to prepare the config file first."

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step: Preparing Chip ID and Config File

Get your device's chip ID:

```bash
adb shell getprop ro.boot.chipid
```

!!! note "üí° chip_id value should consist of 0x + 32 hexadecimal characters (total 34 characters)."

Sample output:

```
0x1234abcd5678ef90123456789abcdef0
```

Create `config.txt` file in `mtk_imei` folder **in JSON format**:

```json
{
  "patch_cert": 0,
  "device": "begonia",
  "kernel": "4.14.186",
  "chip_id": "0x1234abcd5678ef90123456789abcdef0",
  "imei_1": "123456789012345",
  "imei_2": "543210987654321",
  "wifi_mac": "001122334455",
  "bt_mac": "66778899aabb"
}
```

!!! note "The config.txt file must be in JSON format. wifi_mac and bt_mac fields cannot be left blank; they must be 12-digit hexadecimal values."

To get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth MAC addresses:

```bash
adb shell cat /sys/class/net/wlan0/address
adb shell cat /sys/class/bluetooth/hci0/address
```

Check file format:

```bash
file config.txt
```

If CRLF exists, correct it:

```bash
sed -i 's/\r$//' config.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Step: Creating IMEI Repair Package

Create the flashable `.zip` file by running the `mtk_imei.sh` script:

```bash
./mtk_imei.sh
```

When successful, you will get the following output:

```
MTK IMEI patcher by timjosten
Success!
```

The `imei_repair-<device>-<kernel>.zip` file will be created in the `out/` folder.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Step: Taking NVRAM and NVDATA Backup

!!! warning "Always take a backup for recovery after incorrect operation."

Turn on your phone in **TWRP Recovery** mode:

1. Go to **Backup** menu
2. Select **NVRAM** and **NVDATA** partitions
3. Save the backup to SD card or computer

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Step: Flashing IMEI Repair Zip File

Send the IMEI repair file to the phone:

```bash
adb push out/imei_repair-begonia-4.14.186.zip /sdcard/
```

Turn on the phone in TWRP mode:

1. Go to **Install** menu
2. Select `imei_repair-*.zip` file
3. Load by **Swipe to confirm flash**
4. After the process is complete, restart with **Reboot > Recovery**

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Step: Verifying IMEI

After the phone is turned on:

- Check from **Settings > About Phone > IMEI**
- Or enter `*#06#` code on phone keypad

Make sure the IMEI numbers are displayed correctly.

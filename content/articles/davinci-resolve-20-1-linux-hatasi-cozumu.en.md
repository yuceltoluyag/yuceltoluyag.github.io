## üé¨ Introduction: Using DaVinci Resolve on Linux

DaVinci Resolve is one of the world's most powerful software for both professional and hobbyist video editors. üé• While it works seamlessly on Windows and macOS, Linux users sometimes encounter unexpected errors. Especially on Arch Linux and its derivatives (such as **EndeavourOS**, **Manjaro**) when installed via AUR, it's a common problem that Resolve doesn't open.

In this article, we'll address the issue of **DaVinci Resolve 20.1 not opening on Linux**. The error appears as follows:

```bash
/opt/resolve/bin/resolve: symbol lookup error:
/usr/lib/libpango-1.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_once_init_leave_pointer
```

This error, which seems quite complex at first glance, actually stems from a very simple reason: the old libraries bundled within Resolve conflict with the updated versions on your system.

üëâ The solution is quite practical: prevent Resolve from using these old libraries and make it use the updated system versions instead.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è The Cause of the Error: Old Libraries

DaVinci Resolve installs many dependency (library) files to the `/opt/resolve/libs` directory along with the installation. Among these are fundamental GNOME libraries such as `libglib`, `libgio`, and `libgmodule`. However, since the Arch Linux ecosystem is "rolling release," these libraries are constantly updated.

Therefore, the old versions within Resolve conflict with the newer ones on the system, causing errors like "**undefined symbol**".

!!! note "Resolve's own libraries are actually added for compatibility purposes. However, on Arch-based systems, working with updated versions is always more stable."

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Solution Method

You can easily solve the error by following the steps below. üöÄ

### 1. Enter the Resolve Library Directory

First, we go to the directory where Resolve is installed:

```bash
cd /opt/resolve/libs
```

### 2. Create a Backup Directory

Instead of directly deleting the old libraries, we create a new folder called `disabled-libraries` for security:

```bash
sudo mkdir disabled-libraries
```

### 3. Move Old Libraries

Now we move the problematic libraries inside Resolve to this folder:

```bash
sudo mv libglib* disabled-libraries
sudo mv libgio* disabled-libraries
sudo mv libgmodule* disabled-libraries
```

### 4. Restart Resolve

Now Resolve won't find its own old libraries and will use the updated system versions. Try again:

```bash
/opt/resolve/bin/resolve
```

üéâ If everything was done correctly, Resolve will open without problems!

---

## ‚ö° Alternative Method: DaVinci Resolve Checker

There's a Python tool prepared by the community to detect problems during installation: **davinci-resolve-checker.py**.

You can run this to identify missing dependencies and potential errors:

```bash
python3 davinci-resolve-checker.py
```

!!! tip "Although the checker tool doesn't always give 100% accurate results, it helps you quickly spot missing dependencies."

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Precautions

- ‚úÖ When moving files, definitely use `mv`, don't delete files with `rm`.
- ‚úÖ If Resolve still doesn't open, carefully examine the terminal output to see which libraries are conflicting.
- ‚ùå After the solution, you may need to check Resolve's library directory again during system updates.

!!! warning "Don't modify system libraries manually. Only make changes in Resolve's own folder. If you accidentally delete files under /usr/lib, your system may stop working."

## üèÅ Conclusion: Now Resolve Works!

Using DaVinci Resolve on Linux may sometimes require extra steps, but with the right methods, all problems can be overcome. This solution here isn't just for the **20.1 version**, but also a practical method that can be applied if you get the same error in future versions.

To summarize:

- The error stems from Resolve's old libraries.
- You can find a solution by moving `libglib`, `libgio`, `libgmodule` files.
- Now Resolve will use the updated system libraries and open without problems. üéâ

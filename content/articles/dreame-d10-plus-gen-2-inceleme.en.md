## Dreame D10 Plus Gen 2 Review

Hello everyone! 🎉 I want to share my robot vacuum experience with you. As someone who had never used a robot vacuum before, I had some concerns initially. However, after getting the Dreame D10 Plus Gen 2, all my worries disappeared. Here are my experiences and the product's standout features! 👇

## Mapping Performance 🗺️

The robot vacuum mapped the house in about 6-7 minutes. It cleaned a 90 square meter area in just half an hour in standard mode. Even though I reset the mapping several times, it worked smoothly every time. 👍

## Obstacle Overcoming Ability 🚧

It could easily pass between objects like tables and chairs. It performed quite successfully in tight spaces and tried to reach every spot by pushing its limits. It was particularly impressive in overcoming small obstacles. 💪

## Adaptation Ability 🔄

Even when I changed the location of items, it adapted immediately. It worked as if constantly updating itself, without any stuck or deviation issues. The chip on it is the same kind used in autonomous electric vehicles! 🚗💨

## Cleaning Power 🧹

Even in standard mode, it has quite powerful suction. Compared to the traditional vacuums I used before, it provided much more effective cleaning. It left surfaces sparkling clean! ✨

## Battery Usage 🔋

On first use, it came with 40% charge and only consumed 20% charge after cleaning. So it provided quite efficient usage. It works energy-efficient even in long cleaning sessions. 🔌

## User-Friendly Design 🤖

The working principle is quite intuitive and user-friendly. Even when I changed the position of the station, it immediately adapted. Easy to use without any complexity. 📱

## Untested Features ⏳

Since we're in winter months, I didn't have a chance to test the mop feature yet. However, I didn't experience any problems with the suction performance. I'll test the mop feature in summer and update my experiences! ☀️

### Are Spare Parts Easily Available?

I obtain spare parts from the Roborge website. They said the dust bag will be available in April. I didn't use the mop mode, but some users mentioned they had issues with mop spare parts.

In this case, there are two options: Either pressure will be put on Roborge or purchases will be made from abroad. There are compatible models for spare parts, for which I had prepared a list. If I can find the file 😄 I will update the article.

- 💡 Note: In a 90 m² house, the vacuum cleans twice a day. Generally I make changes between 90-93 days. If there are no large debris, it can be easily cleaned. If there are large debris and you don't want to pay for a dust bag, you can clean it with your home handheld vacuum.

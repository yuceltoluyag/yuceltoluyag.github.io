## 1. Introduction 🌟

One of the greatest advantages of Linux users is having a free and customizable working environment. However, sometimes freedom comes at a cost: software incompatibilities and small but annoying problems. 😅

If you're using **Proton Authenticator** in an **X11**-based Linux desktop environment and noticed that the **buttons are not visible** when you open the application, you're not alone. 🤝 The application works and login is possible, but the buttons seem to have become transparent and disappeared. 👻

In this article, you'll find the technical reason for the problem, temporary and permanent solutions, as well as special tips for Flatpak users. 💡

---

## 2. Technical Background of the Problem 🔧

Proton Authenticator uses a web rendering engine called **WebKitGTK** in its desktop version. This engine allows us to create interfaces with web technologies such as HTML and CSS. 🌐

Recently, WebKitGTK has been using a feature called **DMA-BUF Renderer** to improve performance. This technology is particularly useful in GPU-accelerated rendering operations. ⚡ However, some graphics card drivers and desktop managers in **X11 environment** are not fully compatible with this feature. ❌

As a result:

- Some parts of the interface **are not rendered**. 🚫
- Buttons, icons and sometimes texts are not visible. 👀
- Hovering over with mouse may activate the area but it remains visually empty. 🖱️

**Wayland users** generally don't experience this problem because DMA-BUF support is more mature in Wayland. ✅

---

## 3. Temporary Solution: Fix with Terminal Command ⏱️

The fastest solution is to disable the DMA-BUF Renderer when starting Proton Authenticator. You can run the following command in the terminal to do this: 💻

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 proton-authenticator
```

This command disables the DMA-BUF feature for the duration the application runs and the buttons become visible again. ✨

**Disadvantage:** 😞
You need to run this method from the terminal every time. So it's a short-term solution.

---

## 4. Permanent Solution: Fix with `.desktop` File 🏆

Linux desktop environments manage application shortcuts through **.desktop** files. These files determine how the application is run. 📁

For a permanent solution, we can edit the Proton Authenticator's `.desktop` file and define the environment variable there. 🔧

### Step 1: Find the Existing `.desktop` File 🔍

```bash
ls /usr/share/applications | grep -i "proton"
```

For example:

```
Proton Authenticator.desktop
```

### Step 2: Copy the File to Local Directory 📂

To prevent space and capital letter problems, we're making the new file name lowercase and without spaces:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/share/applications"
cp "/usr/share/applications/Proton Authenticator.desktop" "$HOME/.local/share/applications/proton-authenticator-x11-fix.desktop"
```

### Step 3: Edit Its Content ✏️

Add the environment variable to the `Exec` line as follows:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Name=Proton Authenticator (X11 Fix)
Comment=Launch Proton Authenticator with WebKit fix for X11
Exec=env WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 /usr/bin/proton-authenticator
Icon=proton-authenticator
Categories=Utility;
Terminal=false
```

### Step 4: Make It Executable ✔️

```bash
chmod +x "$HOME/.local/share/applications/proton-authenticator-x11-fix.desktop"
```

Now **Proton Authenticator (X11 Fix)** will appear in your application menu. 🎉

---

## 5. Solution for Flatpak Users 📦

If you installed Proton Authenticator via Flatpak, instead of editing the `.desktop` file, you can use the `flatpak override` command: 🐧

```bash
flatpak override --user --env=WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 com.protonmail.proton-authenticator
```

This command automatically applies the environment variable whenever the relevant Flatpak application is run. 🔄

---

## 6. Note for Wayland Users 🌈

Wayland users probably won't experience this problem. 😌

If you switch from X11 to Wayland, you may not need this fix. 🔄➡️🌈

---

## 7. Also Valid for Other Applications 🔄

This problem is not exclusive to Proton Authenticator. Similar problems can occur in other applications that use **WebKitGTK** and have DMA-BUF Renderer enabled. For example: 🧩

- Some email clients 📧
- Web-based desktop applications 🌐
- Some calendar and note-taking tools 📅📝

You can try the same environment variable for these applications. 👨‍🔬

---

## 8. Conclusion 🏁

The invisibility of Proton Authenticator buttons in X11 is caused by **DMA-BUF Renderer incompatibility**. This problem is completely eliminated with a simple environment variable. ✅

- **Short-term solution:** Start with environment variable from terminal. ⏳
- **Permanent solution:** Edit `.desktop` file or use Flatpak override. 🏆

This fix works not only for Proton Authenticator but also for other WebKitGTK-based applications. 💯

I hope this solution makes your Linux experience more trouble-free! 🐧❤️

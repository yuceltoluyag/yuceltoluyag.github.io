## Hello! 👋

I had been planning to write such an article for a long time but never found the opportunity. 😊 In this article, I will talk about applications I frequently use and recommend on **Windows**, **Linux** and **Android** platforms. I hope it will be useful! 🚀

!!! note " I want to turn this article into a series. Let's see if I can do it? 🤞"

## **Comodo Firewall (Firewall) 🔥**

I'm using the **free** version which includes many features such as **container (virtual environment), antivirus, secure browser**. You can run files you don't trust in a virtual environment. A similar feature was also introduced in Windows 10 with **Windows Defender**.

Additionally, you can monitor your network traffic and examine which application sends data where. It's a great option for those who are sensitive about security! 🛡️

## **KeyScrambler 🔑**

This program protects against possible **keylogger attacks** by instantly encrypting the keys you press on the keyboard. If your computer is infected with malicious software, **you can protect your passwords and sensitive data.** 💻🛡️

You can download the program from [here](https://www.qfxsoftware.com/download.htm){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. After installation, restart your computer and view the encryption process in any corner of the screen.

## **0patch 🛠️**

I used this application a lot especially during the **Windows 7** period. When critical security vulnerabilities emerge, it provides temporary protection by providing **mini patches (micro patches)**. I'm also using it on Windows 10. It can be quite useful especially for **corporate companies**.

Don't ask "Who am I in terms of security?", it's always good to take precautions! 😊

## **uBlock Origin 🚫**

After claims that popular ad blockers like **AdBlock** collect user data, I started using **uBlock Origin**, an open source alternative. It's an extremely lightweight and powerful ad blocker!

Recently I'm also using **[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}** and I'm really satisfied. If you're looking for a network-based ad blocker, you should definitely check it out. 😁

## **Ad-Free YouTube Experience on Mobile: Vanced App 📺**

Are you tired of the official YouTube app? Tired of constant ads popping up? Do you want **background playback** feature? Then the solution is: **YouTube Vanced**! 🎉

I've been using this application for about **a year** and I'm very satisfied. To **follow your subscriptions**, you need to install the helper application called **MicroG** before installing the application. Otherwise, you may get an error when logging in.

## **WhatsApp Aero 📱**

**WP Aero**, an advanced version of WhatsApp, offers great features in terms of privacy and personalization:

- **Read messages without being seen** 👀
- **Secretly view stories** 🎭
- **Choose who can call you** 📞
- **Share longer videos** 🎥

Also available is **Insta Aero** developed by the same group. It makes your job much easier when **you don't want to be disturbed via WhatsApp**!

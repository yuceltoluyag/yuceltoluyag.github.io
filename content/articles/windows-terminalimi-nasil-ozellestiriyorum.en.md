## **Hello**

Those who follow my stories on Instagram were asking how I customize my **Windows Terminal**. üôÑ I said wait for my blog post about this topic and that awaited moment has come üòÇü•±

## Ingredients ü•ó

- Nerd Fonts
- Windows Terminal Preview
- Windows PowerShell
- Scoop
- Git
- Oh My Posh
- Terminal Icons
- PSReadLine
- Z
- PSFzf

## Font

If you want **icons** to be displayed correctly in your terminal:

- You **must use** [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
- The full Nerd Fonts collection is more than 2 GB. You don't need to download all of them; you can select and install the font you like. Enjoy! =)

## Microsoft Store

- [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [PowerShell](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MZ1SNWT0N5D){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Install these two applications. After installation, **open** our **Windows Terminal** application and **go to settings**.

After going to settings, your settings in the **appearance** tab should be as follows.


[responsive_img src="/images/windows-terminal2-xl.webp" alt="windows-terminal2" /]


After **saving** the settings, click on the **Startup** section. Set the **Powershell** we installed as **default**.
[responsive_img src="/images/windows-terminal3-xl.webp" alt="windows-terminal3" /]
**Save** the settings and go to the **Defaults** tab, then make your **Font** settings from the **Appearance** section there.

After making your **Font** settings, activate "**Enable Acrylic**" which is on the same screen and **save** the settings.

After doing all these, **close** your **Terminal** and reopen it.

## Scoop

To install Scoop, type the following commands in order:

```shell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
irm get.scoop.sh | iex
```

After installing Scoop, run the following commands to avoid **package not found** errors:

```shell
scoop bucket add main
scoop bucket add extras
```

It will **update the database**. This process may take some **time**.

After installation is complete:

```shell
scoop install curl sudo jq
```

output:

```shell

```

After installation is complete, set up your **Git** settings. **If you don't know**, you can check the [Creating Git ssh-key (windows&linux)](https://yuceltoluyag.github.io/git-ssh-key-olusturma-windows/) article.

## Powershell Config

Make sure you are in your **user directory**: `C:\Users\YourUsername`. Do the operations in this directory. **When you open Terminal**, it opens this directory by default, I'm saying this in case you **changed it**. Then don't say "oh my god it doesn't work for us" :)

```shell
mkdir .config/powershell
```

Then we **create a file named user_profile** under this directory we created.

```shell
nvim .\.config\powershell\user_profile.ps1
```

Write the following lines inside:

```shell
# set PowerShell to UTF-8
[console]::InputEncoding = [console]::OutputEncoding = New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding

Import-Module posh-git
$omp_config = ".\material.omp.json"
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$env:POSH_THEMES_PATH\$omp_config"  | Invoke-Expression

Import-Module -Name Terminal-Icons
Set-PSReadLineOption -EditMode Vi
...
```

After making these settings:

```shell
nvim $PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost
```

Write the following inside:

```shell
.  $env:USERPROFILE\.config\powershell\user_profile.ps1
```

Close and open your Terminal. Let's test:

```shell
ll
```

Write and it will give you the directory output in a colorful way.

## Packages

Let's install our **Oh My Posh** package. Paste the two commands in order to the **terminal** and press enter üòè

```shell
Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser -Force
winget install oh-my-posh
```

Close and open Terminal.

**NVM (NodeJS Version Manager)**

```shell
scoop install nvm # after installation, close and open terminal
nvm install lts
nvm use lts # If it gives an error
```

If you get the following warning when you write `nvm use lts`:

```shell
exit status 1: You do not have sufficient privilege to perform this operation.
```

Close the terminal and run it as administrator. Write `nvm use lts` again and start the terminal normally.

**Terminal Icons**

```shell
Install-Module -Name Terminal-Icons -Repository PSGallery -Force
```

Close and open Terminal, to **test**:

```shell
ll
```

Write the **ll** command and you should see **icons** next to the **file** names.

**Z**

```shell
Install-Module -Name z -Force
```

**PSReadLine**

```shell
Install-Module -Name PSReadLine -AllowPrerelease -Scope CurrentUser -Force -SkipPublisherCheck
```

**FZF**

```shell
scoop install fzf
```

output:

```shell
Installing 'fzf'  (0.30.0)  [64bit]
...
```

**PSFzf**

```shell
Install-Module -Name PSFzf -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

## Don't Teach Me How to Fish, Give Me the Fish

If you're reading this article, you probably know what **Git** is üëä Tools that work seamlessly on Linux sometimes have problems on **Windows**. For example, if you're not having problems using **GPG**, continue using it üß† But if you are having problems, I recommend using "**gpg4win**".

```shell
scoop install gpg4win
```

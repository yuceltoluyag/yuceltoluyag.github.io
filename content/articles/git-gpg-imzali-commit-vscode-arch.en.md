## Guide to Solving GPG Signed Commit Problems on VSCode and Arch Linux

Signing commits with a GPG key is one of the most important ways to increase your security and reliability in the Git world. However, when using minimalist window managers like i3wm on Arch Linux and trying to work from VSCode terminal, you may encounter some specific problems. Especially when you have any AI extension active in VSCode while trying to commit, the password prompt may not work properly. Numbers or some keys behave like they're not being pressed; they're not detected even though you press them multiple times. ðŸ™„

In this article, I'll explain step by step how I solved this problem, what caused it, and the best solution. My goal is to help you reach a process where you can confidently make signed commits, getting out of the "why isn't this password working!" nervous breakdown. ðŸš€

## 1. Why Are Signed Commits Important?

Signing your Git commits with GPG proves that the changes you made truly belong to you. It provides reliability in projects and especially eliminates the "who wrote this code?" question in the open source world.

!!! note "Important : Platforms like GitHub and GitLab automatically verify signed commits and mark them with the "Verified" tag. This increases your reliability."

---

## 2. Where Does the Problem Come From?

Normally, terminal-based input methods like `pinentry-curses` or `pinentry-tty` work properly when asking for password. But when VSCode's integrated terminal and especially AI extensions (such as code completion or assistant helpers) get involved, things get mixed up. The terminal's key capture mechanism breaks down; some numbers are not detected even though you press them multiple times. Result: you can't enter the password correctly no matter what.

### Example situation

```bash
$ git commit -S -m "Fix bug"
gpg: signing failed: No pinentry
error: gpg failed to sign the data
```

Or even more frustrating: The password prompt opens but keys work partially.

---

## 3. Checking Existing Pinentry Programs

When you install the `pinentry` package on Arch Linux, actually many different versions come with it:

```bash
pacman -Ql pinentry | grep bin/
```

The output is usually as follows:

```
/usr/bin/pinentry
/usr/bin/pinentry-curses
/usr/bin/pinentry-emacs
/usr/bin/pinentry-gnome3
/usr/bin/pinentry-gtk
/usr/bin/pinentry-qt
/usr/bin/pinentry-qt5
/usr/bin/pinentry-tty
```

So we have many options including terminal-based (`curses`, `tty`) and GUI-based (`gtk`, `qt`, `gnome3`).

---

## 4. Solution: Using GUI Pinentry

Here's the critical point: My problem was happening only when AI was running inside VSCode. While everything was fine in normal terminal, the password prompt was completely broken inside VSCode. The only way to overcome this was to use a GUI-based solution instead of terminal-based pinentry.

### Correct configuration (GUI recommended):

```ini
# ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-gtk
default-cache-ttl 43200
max-cache-ttl 43200
```

Then restart the agent:

```bash
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
```

!!! tip "When terminal-based input breaks with VSCode + AI combination, `pinentry-gtk` saves the day. Now you can enter your password completely and without problems."

---

## 5. Git Config Settings

Make sure the following lines are in your `.gitconfig` file:

```ini
[user]
    name = YourUsername
    email = mail@example.com
    signingkey = KEY_ID

[gpg]
    program = gpg

[commit]
    gpgSign = true
```

To see your key ID:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
```

Add the long hex value from the `sec` line as `signingkey`.

---

## 6. Making Commit and Push

If the commit phase passes without problems, a GUI window will open and ask for your password. After entering the password, the commit is successfully signed.

But remember: the commit is saved to the **local** repository. To make it visible on GitHub, you need to `push`.

```bash
git commit -S -m "Added new feature"
git push origin main
```

!!! warning "Common mistake: Not seeing the commit on GitHub after making it. The reason is forgetting to push."

---

## 7. Workflow Recommendation

1. Edit files

```bash
  git add .
```

2. Make signed commit

```bash
  git commit -S -m "Fix typo"
```

3. Send changes to GitHub

```bash
  git push origin main
```

!!! note "Thanks to the `default-cache-ttl` setting, even if you make multiple commits on the same day, the password won't be asked every time."

---

## 8. Conclusion

Now you've solved the "keys don't work, numbers aren't detected" problem when making GPG signed commits on VSCode, in the Arch Linux + i3wm environment âœ…. Especially when working with AI extensions, if terminal-based `pinentry` fails, `pinentry-gtk` is your most reliable solution.

From now on, you'll see the proudly standing "Verified" tag next to your commits on GitHub. ðŸŽ‰

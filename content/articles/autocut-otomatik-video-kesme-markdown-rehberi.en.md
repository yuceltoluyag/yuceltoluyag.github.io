## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installation and Preparation ‚öôÔ∏è

First, create a **Python virtual environment** and install the necessary packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install moviepy autocut

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Video Transcription and Markdown Creation ‚úçÔ∏è

With Autocut, you can first transcribe your video and generate a Markdown output:

```bash
autocut -t -c -m --lang Turkish --device cuda /home/friday13/Videos/editle.mp4
```

- `-t` ‚Üí Transcription
- `-c` ‚Üí Cutting
- `-m` ‚Üí Create Markdown
- `--lang Turkish` ‚Üí Language selection
- `--device cuda` ‚Üí Process with GPU

!!! note "The Markdown output allows you to mark which sentences to keep. This way, unnecessary parts are skipped during cutting."

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Markdown Editing

Each line in the Markdown file should be in the following format:

```
- [x] [index,time] sentence
- [ ] [index,time] <No Speech>
```

- `[x]` ‚Üí Sentence to remain in video
- `[ ]` ‚Üí Section to be deleted

Example:

```markdown
- [x] [1,00:00] Yes, dear friends...
- [ ] [6,00:23] <No Speech>
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cutting Video and Getting Output üé¨

Once Markdown and SRT are ready, you can cut your video:

```bash
autocut -c /home/friday13/Videos/editle.mp4 /home/friday13/Videos/editle.srt /home/friday13/Videos/editle.md
```

- MoviePy combines video and audio into a new file.
- Example output: `/home/friday13/Videos/editle_cut.mp4`
- Original duration: 317.8 sec ‚Üí Cut duration: 181 sec

!!! note "The cut video contains only the marked sentences. Unnecessary spaces and "No Speech" parts are removed."

## 🍷 What is WinePrefix and Why is it Important?

If you're using Wine to run Windows games and applications on Linux, you've definitely encountered the `WINEPREFIX` concept. Thanks to this environment variable, you can create isolated virtual Windows environments for different programs and run them without any problems.

In this guide:

- What is `WINEPREFIX`?
- How to create it?
- How to install games with different prefixes?
- How to use with practical examples?
- `winecfg`, `winetricks`, `regedit` and debugging tips
- Integration with Lutris and Steam/Proton 🎯

We show all of them step by step. 🎯

## 🧠 1. What is WinePrefix?

`WINEPREFIX` is an environment variable that specifies **which folder Wine should create and run the Windows-like file system**.

Each prefix is actually an independent "virtual Windows" folder.
This way, you can create different environments for one game with 32-bit compatibility, another with 64-bit compatibility, one with DirectX9 and another with DirectX11.

> 🎮 **Why is it important in games?**
> Because the DLL files, system settings and registry entries that a game needs can conflict with other games. `WINEPREFIX` completely isolates these problems.

---

## 🧱 2. How to See WinePrefix Directory?

A `WINEPREFIX` directory usually has the following structure:

```text
~/.wine/ (or specially designated folder)
├── drive_c/         → Virtual C:\ drive
├── system.reg       → System registry
├── user.reg         → User registry
├── userdef.reg      → Default user records
```

In this structure, any program you install in `drive_c` works just like in a Windows system.

> 💡 Default Wine directory: `~/.wine`
> But we recommend using a different folder for each game: `~/wineprefixes/gamename` etc.

---

## 🛠️ 3. How to Create WinePrefix?

### 🎯 Example: Creating a new `WINEPREFIX` for PES 2017

```bash
export WINEPREFIX=~/wineprefixes/pes2017
wineboot -u
```

These two commands:

1. Defines a new folder (`~/wineprefixes/pes2017`).
2. Sets up virtual Windows environment in prefix with `wineboot -u`.

> 🛡️ This process creates basic files just like a real Windows installation: `C:\`, registry, config files etc.

---

## ▶️ 4. Running Applications Through Prefix

### Example: Starting an `.exe` file in a special prefix

```bash
export WINEPREFIX=~/wineprefixes/pes2017
wine ~/Downloads/Settings.exe
```

With this command:

- `Settings.exe` application runs only in the Windows environment in `~/wineprefixes/pes2017`.
- Registry and installed DLLs are specific to this prefix.

> 🔄 This way it's possible to run each game in different systems.

---

## 🎮 5. Applied Scenario: Installing PES 2017

### Step 1: Create Prefix

```bash
export WINEPREFIX=~/peswine
wineboot -u
```

### Step 2: Customize configurations as needed

```bash
winecfg        # Configure Wine settings
winetricks     # DLL installation tool (e.g. d3dx9)
```

### Step 3: Install the game

```bash
wine setup.exe
```

> If the setup file works on Windows, it should work exactly the same here.

---

## ▶️ Starting the Game

```bash
export WINEPREFIX=~/peswine
wine "C:\Program Files\PES2017\pes2017.exe"
```

> 🗂️ Wine automatically maps this directory as follows:
> `"C:\Program Files"` → `~/peswine/drive_c/Program Files`

---

## 🧩 6. Regedit and Registry Editing

You can edit registry settings in Wine with the following command:

```bash
WINEPREFIX=~/peswine wine regedit
```

Here you can see HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_CURRENT_USER structures just like in many Windows programs, and you can manually add and delete keys.

> ⚠️ Warning: Incorrect registry edits can break the program's operation.

## 💡 7. Useful Tips

| Tip                                                   | Explanation                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Use separate `WINEPREFIX` for each game               | Prevents conflicts and confusion        |
| Default prefix is `~/.wine`                           | Uses this if you don't specify anything |
| Specify prefix when installing DLLs with `winetricks` | `WINEPREFIX=... winetricks ...`         |

### 🎯 DLL Installation Example:

```bash
WINEPREFIX=~/peswine winetricks d3dx9
```

---

## 🧪 8. Debugging and Log Tracking

You can use `WINEDEBUG` to see errors that may occur when running Wine applications:

```bash
WINEPREFIX=~/peswine WINEDEBUG=+seh wine pes2017.exe
```

Also with the `winecfg` tool:

- DirectX version
- Windows version
- Audio driver

You can change settings like these.

---

## 💾 9. Prefix Backup and Copying

Since each `WINEPREFIX` is a folder, it can be easily backed up:

```bash
tar czvf peswine-backup.tar.gz ~/peswine
```

On another system, you can extract this backup and use the game directly:

```bash
tar xzvf peswine-backup.tar.gz -C ~/
```

---

## 🔄 10. Prefix Management with Lutris

When installing games through Lutris, `WINEPREFIX` is automatically created for each game.
The relevant prefix is usually found here:

```
~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/prefix/
```

But it can be customized. Lutris manages these operations automatically in the background.

---

## 🛠️ 11. Using Prefix with Steam/Proton

Games running with Proton on Steam also use prefix similarly. These prefixes are usually located here:

```
~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/APPID/pfx/
```

Here `APPID` is the game's Steam App ID. You can intervene with this prefix using tools like `regedit`, `winetricks`, `winecfg`:

```bash
WINEPREFIX=~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/APPID/pfx winetricks corefonts
```

## ✅ 12. Quick Command Table

| Command                 | Purpose                   |

| `export WINEPREFIX=...` | Specifies prefix          |
| `wineboot -u`           | Creates new prefix        |
| `wine file.exe`         | Runs application          |
| `winetricks dll`        | Installs DLL (e.g: d3dx9) |
| `winecfg`               | Configures settings       |
| `wine regedit`          | Edits registry            |
| `WINEDEBUG=...`         | Shows error logs          |

- 🧩 Isolate incompatible games
- 🔧 Make special configurations
- 💣 Prevent problematic games from affecting the whole system
- 🗂️ Backup each prefix in a separate folder

---

`WINEPREFIX` is a fundamental concept that everyone running games and applications on Linux should learn.
With this guide, you can now:

- Create your own prefixes,
- Install DLLs,
- Edit registry,
- Use with Lutris and Steam integration,

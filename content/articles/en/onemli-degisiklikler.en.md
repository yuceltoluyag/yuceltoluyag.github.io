## Code Blocks

On this page, we are testing code blocks of different programming languages. Below you can find examples in various languages.

### Bash/Shell

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World!"
cd /var/www/html
ls -la
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Below is a Python code block with syntax highlighting enabled.

#### Python

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()

# Class example
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, I am {self.name}. I am {self.age} years old."
```

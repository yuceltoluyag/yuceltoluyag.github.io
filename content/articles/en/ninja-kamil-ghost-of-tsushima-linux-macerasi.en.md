## ⚙️ Technical Issues and First Impressions (00:00:00)

The stream starts with literally **a bang**: Power outage!
Ninja Kamil fights with his phone's auto-rotate settings, apologizes occasionally and adjusts volume levels. 🎧
Running _Ghost of Tsushima_ on Linux isn't easy: resolution, FPS limit, FSR and anti-aliasing lead to a complete optimization struggle.

> "Next-generation games can't be played without freezing anymore," says Kamil, questioning Nvidia drivers.
> But he doesn't give up — because a Linux user fights. 💪🐧

---

## 🗡️ Diving Into Gameplay (00:05:00)

The game finally starts... but the settings menu opens immediately. 😅
FPS limitation, shadow quality, screen brightness — all are tested individually.
Kamil describes character control as "riding a drunk horse". 🐎
He encounters other players, experiences ridiculous dialogues and chaotic combat scenes.
He can't understand why the character in the game looks tired all the time:

> "Dude is sweating just from walking!"

---

## 🧩 Performance Battles (00:10:00)

OBS maxes out CPU usage.
Kamil's Linux stream progresses on one side with _Ghost of Tsushima_, and on the other with "What's the FPS?" obsession.
When stuttering begins, the solution is ready:

> "Should I switch to Shadowplay? But that's on Windows too..."

Still, he doesn't give up trying. To improve stream performance, he minimizes graphic settings, but the game's artistic beauty remains impressive. 🌸

!!! tip "When using OBS on Linux, try enabling <code>ffmpeg_vaapi</code> or <code>nvenc</code> hardware acceleration to reduce frame drops."

---

## 🎬 Philosophical Waves on Asian Cinema (00:15:00)

Suddenly the game stops, chat begins:
Kamil talks about the classic cycle of Asian cinema:

> "Guy gets beaten up, wakes up, woman beside him, then an old master arrives..."

He claims it hasn't changed since 1985.
At this moment, the game stream literally exits _Ghost of Tsushima_ and transforms into _Cine5 nostalgia_. 🎞️

---

## 🥷 Silence and Samurai Attempts (00:20:00)

Kamil finally switches to stealth mode.
But enemy AI is inconsistent:
One enemy comes right up to his nose but doesn't hear; another hears whispering through walls.

> "Bro, one of you is deaf, the other Batman?"

Struggles to find direction in darkness, looks for light, wants a sword...
Suddenly: "Someone give me a torch, I can't see anything!"

!!! warning "Some graphics engines on Linux may work with low gamma values. Increase the in-game "Brightness" setting above 60%."

---

## 😤 Final Chapter: Patience Test (00:25:00)

Phone rings, FPS drops, OBS gives error — complete chaos!
But Ninja Kamil has no intention of giving up.

> "If it closes, let it close, I'll finish this game!"

He finds humor in every difficulty, makes a joke out of every bug.
Towards the end of the stream, tired but determined:
Even on Linux, Tsushima will be conquered. 🇯🇵🐧

---

## 🎯 Conclusion: Fun Within Chaos

Ninja Kamil's _Ghost of Tsushima_ adventure was a fantastic "real world" stream for both gamers and Linux users.
Technical errors, freezes, unexpected phone calls...
But ultimately what remained was pure entertainment.

!!! important "Technical errors encountered in streams may be frustrating, but they can transform into the purest form of humor for viewers. Broadcasting on Linux especially requires courage!"

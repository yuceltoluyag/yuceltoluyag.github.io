## Automatic Video Cutting with Autocut 🎬

## Introduction 📝

Video content creation becomes more intense and competitive day by day. Especially on YouTube and social media platforms, removing unnecessary parts from long recordings is critical to improve content quality and viewer experience. However, manual video editing is a time-consuming process with a high risk of errors.

In this guide, you'll learn step-by-step how to automatically cut your videos with the **Python-based Autocut tool**, and how to manage them with SRT subtitles and Markdown-based markings. We'll also explain the video and audio merging process with **MoviePy** in detail. Throughout the guide, you'll be able to easily follow the process with example commands, tips, and information boxes.

## 2️⃣ Installation and Preparation ⚙️

First, create a **Python virtual environment** and install the necessary packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install moviepy autocut
```

To check:

```bash
which python
which pip
which autocut
```

Your system should have **FFmpeg** installed:

```bash
which ffmpeg
```

## 3️⃣ Video Transcription and Markdown Creation ✍️

With Autocut, you can first transcribe your video and generate a Markdown output:

```bash
autocut -t -c -m --lang Turkish --device cuda /home/friday13/Videos/editle.mp4
```

- `-t` → Transcription
- `-c` → Cutting
- `-m` → Create Markdown
- `--lang Turkish` → Language selection
- `--device cuda` → Process with GPU

!!! note "The Markdown output allows you to mark which sentences to keep. This way, unnecessary parts are skipped during cutting."

---

## 4️⃣ Markdown Editing

Each line in the Markdown file should be in the following format:

```
- [x] [index,time] sentence
- [ ] [index,time] <No Speech>
```

- `[x]` → Sentence to remain in video
- `[ ]` → Section to be deleted

Example:

```markdown
- [x] [1,00:00] Yes, dear friends...
- [ ] [6,00:23] <No Speech>
```

---

## 5️⃣ Cutting Video and Getting Output 🎬

Once Markdown and SRT are ready, you can cut your video:

```bash
autocut -c /home/friday13/Videos/editle.mp4 /home/friday13/Videos/editle.srt /home/friday13/Videos/editle.md
```

- MoviePy combines video and audio into a new file.
- Example output: `/home/friday13/Videos/editle_cut.mp4`
- Original duration: 317.8 sec → Cut duration: 181 sec

!!! note "The cut video contains only the marked sentences. Unnecessary spaces and 'No Speech' parts are removed."

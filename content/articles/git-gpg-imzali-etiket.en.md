## Creating GPG Signed Tags with Git and Troubleshooting üîê

In the development process, **Git tags** are an important feature used to mark specific versions. However, **signing these tags with GPG** increases the reliability of your version and prevents unauthorized changes. In this article, we'll explain the process of **creating GPG signed tags with Git** and how to fix possible errors you may encounter. üöÄ

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Your GPG Key

If you don't have a GPG key yet, you can create a new key with the following command:

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

After the key is created, you can use the following command to learn your ID:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
```

This command will show the details of your key. Note the long key ID found under the **sec** tag in the output. For example:

```plaintext
sec   rsa4096/8416A43957C19627 2022-04-25 [SC] [expires: 2025-08-23]
```

Here **8416A43957C19627** part is your **key ID**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Git with GPG

To make Git **use your GPG key**, run the following command:

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey 8416A43957C19627
```

Also, if you want to sign Git commits by default, you can run the following command:

```bash
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Signed Git Tag ‚úçÔ∏è

After introducing your GPG key to Git, you can create a signed tag with the following command:

```bash
git tag -s 0.0.3 -m "Version 0.0.3' by Jekyll"
```

**To see existing tags:**

```bash
git tag
```

**To verify a tag:**

```bash
git tag -v 0.0.3
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Push Tag to Remote Repository ‚òÅÔ∏è

To send your signed tag to GitHub or another remote repository, you can use the following command:

```bash
git push origin 0.0.3
```

If you want to send all tags at once:

```bash
git push --tags
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Windows Terminal and Git Bash GPG Issues üîç

If you're using **Windows Terminal** or **Git Bash** and your GPG key works in one but doesn't appear in the other, this may be related to environment variables.

### üîß Solution:

1. Check your **home directory** in Git Bash:

```bash
  echo $HOME
```

2. Check your user profile in Windows Terminal:

```bash
  echo %USERPROFILE%
```

**Make sure both directories are the same!**

3. Set the following environment variable in Windows Terminal:

```bash
  set GNUPGHOME=C:\Users\yucel\.gnupg
```

4. Import your GPG key:

```bash
  gpg --import C:\Users\yucel\.gnupg\my-private-key.asc
```

5. Introduce your key to Git again:

```bash
  git config --global user.signingkey 8416A43957C19627
```

6. Now check again:

```bash
  gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
```

If the output is empty, check if **GPG is installed system-wide**.

## üéØ Conclusion

By following these steps, you can **create Git tags signed with GPG**, share your tags safely, and **solve GPG problems between Windows Terminal & Git Bash**. üî•

GPG signatures are of great importance in **open source projects, security-required corporate projects, and sensitive development processes**. Get used to using them! ‚úÖ

üìå **Extra Information**: If you lose your GPG key, you need to create a new key and start using this new key in projects. Don't forget to **revoke your old key!** üö®

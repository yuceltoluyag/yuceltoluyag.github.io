Hello! ðŸŽ¥ Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is one of the best applications for video recording and live streaming. However, since there aren't enough Turkish resources about the plugin installation process on Linux environment, I prepared this guide. I won't explain how to use OBS, because there's already enough content about this topic. In this article, we'll learn **how to add the Linux Browser plugin to OBS and how to integrate Discord StreamKit**.

## Installation

We'll add a plugin to OBS and perform **Discord StreamKit** integration as a test. ðŸŽ¤ðŸ’¬

!!! warning "<b>Update: Linux Browser Plugin now comes by default. You don't need to install it extra!</b> ðŸš€"

- ~~[obs-linuxbrowser](https://github.com/bazukas/obs-linuxbrowser/releases){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}~~ (Old method, no longer necessary. Don't install!)
- [Discord StreamKit](https://discordapp.com/streamkit){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

You can do these operations manually, but I prefer doing it through terminal.

### Installation via Terminal (Old Method)

If the plugin doesn't come by default, you can use the following commands manually:

```bash
wget https://github.com/bazukas/obs-linuxbrowser/releases/download/0.6.1/linuxbrowser0.6.1-obs23.0.2-64bit.tgz
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/obs-studio/plugins
tar xfvz linuxbrowser0.6.1-obs23.0.2-64bit.tgz -C $HOME/.config/obs-studio/plugins/
```

## After Installation

After completing these steps, the plugin will be successfully added to **OBS's plugin folder**. **When you want to install another plugin, you can use the same directory**.

## Usage

### 1. Opening Linux Browser Plugin on OBS

Open OBS and press the **Sources (+) button** and select the **Linux Browser** option.

### 4. Adding URL in OBS

Open the **Linux Browser** source in OBS and **paste the connection provided by Discord StreamKit into the URL field**.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If you have CSS knowledge, you can make customizations on the screen to get a more stylish look! ðŸŽ¨

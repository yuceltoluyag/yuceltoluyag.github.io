## C++17 Compilation Error and Solution When Installing Sharp Module in Node.js

Did you encounter a strange compilation error like the one below when installing the **sharp** module, which you use to meet your image processing needs while developing with Node.js?

> `error: 'std::string_view' has not been declared`

This error is usually a classic **C++17 compatibility** issue that happens to Arch Linux users. Fortunately, the solution is quite simple! In this guide, we explain in detail why this error occurs and **step-by-step solution methods**. 🚀

---

## 🔍 What is Sharp and Why Does This Error Occur?

`sharp` is a high-performance **image processing library** for Node.js. It can work with formats like PNG, JPEG, WebP, resize, crop and convert images. However, its power requires some system dependencies.

During installation, if your system does not have the **required compiler features**, especially lack of C++17 support features, the installation fails.

---

## ⚠️ Encountered Error Detail

The typical error message during installation is as follows:

```js
/home/user/.cache/node-gyp/22.15.0/include/node/node.h:541:32: error: 'std::string_view' has not been declared
  541 |   static Pointer FromBlob(std::string_view in);
      |                                ^~~~~~~~~~~
```

As you can see in this message, `std::string_view` is not recognized. This is a feature that comes with C++17. If the compiler still uses C++11 or an older standard, these functions are not supported and give an error.

---

## 🔧 How to Solve C++17 Compilation Error?

These types of problems usually occur due to **missing flags** or **incompatible compiler version**. You can solve the problem by following the steps below.

### ✅ 1. Set Compiler Flag

First, enter the following command in the terminal to tell the compiler to use the C++17 standard:

```bash
export CXXFLAGS="--std=c++17"
```

This command informs the C++ compiler on the system of the required standard.

> **Tip:** If you don't want to do this process constantly, you can add it to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

---

### ♻️ 2. Reinstall Sharp Module

Then try reinstalling the `sharp` module:

```bash
npm install sharp
```

At this point, `node-gyp` will compile in a C++17 compatible way and the previous error will no longer appear.

---

### 🧪 3. Check Compiler and Node.js Compatibility

If the error persists:

* Check your `g++` version: `g++ --version`
* Check your Node.js version: `node -v`

Make sure both components are up to date. Especially your `g++` version should be 7 or higher (for C++17 support).

> Alternatively, you can try again with a compatible Node.js version using an `nvm` environment.

---

## 🧹 Extra Tips

 - `export CXXFLAGS="--std=c++17"` will solve your problem, but here are some extra tips for Linux users:

* **Install required development packages:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel gcc
```

* **Install node-gyp globally and keep it up to date:**

```bash
npm install -g node-gyp
```

* If `node-gyp` still gives an error, check your `python` version and make sure you have **Python 3.6+** on your system:

```bash
python --version
```

* Also, you can guarantee the `sharp` module's access to system libraries by installing the `libvips` library:

```bash
sudo pacman -S libvips
```

* You can switch to a compatible Node version using **nvm**, a common Node.js management tool:

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

## 📌 Summary and Conclusion

In this article, we focused on the **C++17-based compilation error encountered when installing the `sharp` module in Node.js environment** and explained step by step how to solve it.

### Briefly the steps:

1. `export CXXFLAGS="--std=c++17"`
2. `npm install sharp`
3. Make sure dependencies like `gcc`, `libvips` and `node-gyp` are installed
4. Update Node.js and `g++` version if necessary
5. Please check the [Sharp Documentation](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install/) address.

With this method, there is a 90% probability that the problem will be solved. If you still have problems, you can consult support forums with the log output.

## How to Install and Use Transmission on Arch Linux?

Transmission is an open-source BitTorrent client. It is known for being fast, lightweight, and easy to use. In this article, we will explain in detail with comprehensive steps how to install and configure Transmission on Arch Linux. Additionally, we will show you how to use Transmission from both command line (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI). Whether you are downloading torrent files or sharing torrents, this guide will help you.

## 1. Step: Installing Transmission

Installing Transmission on Arch Linux is quite simple. You can easily perform the installation using the `pacman` package manager. You can choose one of two versions depending on your needs: the command line version or the graphical user interface (GUI) version.

### 1.1 Installing Command Line (CLI) Version

To install the command line version of Transmission, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S transmission-cli
```

This command installs Transmission that you can only run from command line.

### 1.2 Installing Graphical (GUI) Version

If you are using a desktop environment and prefer a more user-friendly interface, you can use the following command to install the graphical version:

```bash
sudo pacman -S transmission-gtk
```

This version provides a visual interface and allows you to manage your torrents more easily.

## 2. Step: Starting Transmission

After installing Transmission, you can start using it immediately. Here, we will examine how to start Transmission from command line (CLI) and graphical interface (GUI).

### 2.1 Starting Transmission Daemon (Command Line)

To run Transmission in the background, you need to start it as a daemon. You can use the following command to do this:

```bash
transmission-daemon
```

This command starts Transmission as a service. Now you can manage Torrent files via web interface or command line.

### 2.2 Accessing Transmission via Web Interface

After starting Transmission, you can also access the web interface. The web interface works through the following URL in your internet browser:

```
http://localhost:9091
```

By default, the Transmission web interface is only accessible from localhost. You may need to edit the configuration file to make it accessible from outside.

## 3. Step: Transmission Configuration

To start using Transmission, you may need to edit the configuration file. The configuration file is generally saved as `settings.json` and located in the following directory:

```bash
~/.config/transmission-daemon/settings.json
```

### 3.1 Enabling Web Interface

If you want to access the web interface, you need to edit the `settings.json` file. You can enable the web interface by setting the following parameters to `true`:

```json
"rpc-enabled": true,
"rpc-bind-address": "0.0.0.0",  // 0.0.0.0 for external access
"rpc-port": 9091,  // Port to connect to web interface
"rpc-whitelist": "127.0.0.1",  // For local network access
"rpc-whitelist-enabled": true
```

### 3.2 Speed Limits and Other Settings

You can also use the configuration file to limit download and upload speeds through Transmission. For example:

```json
"download-limit": 1000000,  // 1 MB/s download speed
"upload-limit": 1000000,    // 1 MB/s upload speed
```

---

## 4. Step: Running Transmission as System Service

If you want Transmission to start automatically at every boot, you can configure it as a system service.

### 4.1 Creating Systemd Service

You can start Transmission as a systemd service by following the steps below.

1. **Create Service File:**

```bash
  sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/transmission-daemon.service
```

2. **Edit Service File:**
   The content of the service file should be as follows:

```ini
  [Unit]
  Description=Transmission Daemon
  After=network.target

  [Service]
  User=yourusername
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/transmission-daemon --foreground --no-daemon
  ExecStop=/usr/bin/transmission-daemon --stop
  Restart=always

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. **Start and Enable Service:**
   After saving this service file, you can start and enable the service with the following commands:

```bash
  sudo systemctl enable transmission-daemon
  sudo systemctl start transmission-daemon
```

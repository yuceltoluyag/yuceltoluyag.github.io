## 👶 First Impression: Came on Recommendation

Initially, we were looking for a double-handled, classic bottle. We had tried one of the models commonly found in Turkish homes, made of lightweight plastic. However, since our child couldn't hold it comfortably, we were looking for a different alternative.

A close friend named Burak recommended us **Philips Avent's glass bottle model**. From the moment we started using the product, we clearly saw the difference. We were really satisfied! Now I will list why I recommend this bottle with peace of mind. 👇

## ⭐ Why You Should Choose This Bottle?

### 🧷 1. Natural Transition with Breast-like Design

The nipple tip and body of the product are designed to be **similar to breast milk**. This provides a more natural sucking experience for the baby. It provides great convenience especially during the transition period from breastfeeding to bottle feeding.

### 💨 2. Advanced Breathing System

One of the biggest advantages of the glass bottle is that it has an **air permeability system**. This way, the baby doesn't struggle during feeding and **breathes comfortably**. At first we thought he couldn't lift the bottle lightly but the real problem was breath control!

### 🔧 3. High Quality and Ergonomic Design

Both the **material quality** and **ergonomic structure** of the bottle are very successful. Thanks to its glass construction, it doesn't contain chemicals and provides safe use. Also, its form is designed to fit comfortably in the baby's hand.

## 🔄 Comparison: Handleless Design is Also Practical!

Although we initially thought that double-handled models would be better, the handleless design of this product turned out to be surprisingly practical. Our baby can **grasp and carry this glass bottle without any difficulty**. 👏

- Compared to lightweight plastic bottles, it gives a more robust feeling and this makes the product safer.
- Our 4-month-old baby can easily hold this bottle.

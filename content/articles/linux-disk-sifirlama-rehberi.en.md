💣 **Disk reset in Linux** is sometimes inevitable for system administrators and technical users. Whether it's before a new installation, while deleting old data, or cleaning disks in a way that can't be reversed, it's very important to proceed with the correct methods.

In this guide, I'll explain in detail how you can **safely and effectively reset any disk** in the format `/dev/sdX`. I'll also explain with examples when each method is appropriate.

## 🧠 Why Do You Need Disk Reset?

Disk reset need may arise in the following situations:

- Clean start before new OS installation
- Deleting data in a way that can't be recovered
- Getting rid of faulty partition structures on disk
- Preparation for disk format change or zero-based partitioning

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Resetting the wrong disk may cause the system to become completely unusable. **Check disk names carefully.**

---

## 🛠️ List and Check Disks

To see your disks and connected partitions:

```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

Alternatively:

```bash
lsblk
```

In the output, you'll see disk names like `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`. After clearly identifying the disk you want to reset, proceed with the operation.

## ⚡ Method 1: Disk Reset with `dd`

`dd` erases by filling the disk with zeros (0). It's a simple but powerful tool.

```bash
# Example: Resetting /dev/sdX disk
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
```

Explanations:

- `if=/dev/zero`: Input source produces zero bytes
- `of=/dev/sdX`: Target disk
- `bs=1M`: 1 MB block size for faster operation
- `status=progress`: Real-time progress status

> 🕒 This operation may take a long time depending on disk size (e.g. 10-30 minutes for 500 GB).

---

## 🔐 Method 2: Secure Erasure with `shred`

`shred` is used when data needs to be deleted in a way that can't be recovered.

```bash
sudo shred -v -n 3 /dev/sdX
```

Explanations:

- `-v`: Verbose output
- `-n 3`: Write random data 3 times over
- `-z`: (optional) Write zeros in final pass

> 🔐 This method is especially suitable for personal data or sensitive files.

---

## 🧼 Method 3: Cleaning File System Traces with `wipefs`

It's a fast method to only delete partition and file system signatures:

```bash
sudo wipefs -a /dev/sdX
```

- `-a`: Cleans all file system signatures

> ⚡ Fast, but physical data may remain on disk.

---

## 🔍 Check Disk Status After Cleaning

After the erasure operation is complete, you can check with the following commands:

```bash
lsblk
sudo fdisk -l
```

If partition is not visible, the disk has been successfully cleaned.

## 🧾 When Should You Use Which Method?

| Method   | Description                               | Speed     | Security |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| `dd`     | Fills disk with zeros                     | Medium    | Medium   |
| `shred`  | Obliterates data with random data         | Slow      | High     |
| `wipefs` | Erases partition tables and FS signatures | Very Fast | Low      |

**For critical data**, `shred` is the best choice. **If only pre-installation reset is needed**, `dd` or `wipefs` is sufficient.

---

## 🚀 Bonus: Disk Partitioning and Formatting After Reset

To create a new file system:

```bash
sudo parted /dev/sdX mklabel gpt
sudo parted /dev/sdX mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1
```

> Other file systems like `xfs`, `btrfs` can also be used instead of `ext4`.

## 📣 Result: Safe and Conscious Disk Cleaning Is Essential

Resetting disks in Linux is very important both for system security and stability. Do not perform any operation without being **100% sure** of which disk you're deleting. Extra caution is necessary especially on servers or systems with multiple disks.

> "Making a Git commit" is like bread and water in the programmer's world. If you're writing code, you have to know how to save your changes to version control system. In this guide, I'll explain the process of **committing** to a project on **GitHub** from scratch, step by step with plenty of examples.
> **Important update:** We don't send directly to the main repository, instead we work on **our own branch** and always send with **Pull Request (PR)**. I'll also explain how to set up with **virtualenv + duty** to view and test the project locally.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What You Need to Read Before Starting This Article

If you haven't added an SSH key with Git before, or haven't looked at GPG signed commit/tag topics, definitely read these two articles first:

- [Creating Git SSH-Key (Windows & Linux)](/git-ssh-key-olusturma/) üîë
- [Creating GPG Signed Tags with Git](/git-gpg-imzali-etiket/) ‚úçÔ∏è

!!! note "For this guide to proceed smoothly, Git must be installed, your SSH key should be added to GitHub, your GPG key must be defined for commit signatures, and Python must be installed (we'll use virtualenv and <code>duty</code>)."

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

### Check Git Installation

Open your terminal and run this command:

```bash
git --version
```

Example output:

```
git version 2.50.1
```

If Git isn't installed, you can install it from [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

### Log in to GitHub Account

If you don't have a GitHub account, quickly create one at [github.com](https://github.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. If you have one, log in from browser.

### Test SSH Connection

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If successful, you'll see a message like this:

```
Hi yuceltoluyag! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

### Check GPG Key

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey
```

If the key doesn't appear, set it up by following the GPG tutorial.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

Example repo: **yuceltoluyag.github.io**
[responsive_img src="/images/github-commit-atma-rehberi-xl.webp" alt="GitHub Repo Cloning" /]

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yuceltoluyag/yuceltoluyag.github.io.git
cd yuceltoluyag.github.io
```

!!! tip "If you want to clone with HTTPS: <code>git clone https://github.com/yuceltoluyag/yuceltoluyag.github.io.git</code>. However, HTTPS requests username/password during push; SSH is usually more convenient."

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Work on Your Own Branch: Why and How?

We don't <b>commit/push directly to the main branch</b> (usually <code>main</code>). Instead we create our own branch and work there. This way the main repository structure isn't broken, all contributions come via <b>Pull Request (PR)</b>.

Create new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b my-branch
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b friend-landing-update
```

!!! tip "Choose short, descriptive and hyphenated branch names: <code>bugfix-typo-footer</code>, <code>feature-new-article-template</code>, etc."

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ First Time Local Setup (virtualenv + duty)

It's very important to run the project locally so you can see and test your changes. The following steps are for <b>initial setup</b>:

```bash
# 1) Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 2) Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate     # Linux/Mac
# Windows PowerShell: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 3) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4) Update project tasks/dependencies
duty update

# 5) Open in editor (optional but recommended)
code .

# 6) Start local server with live reload
duty livereload
```

You'll see the <b>local URL</b> in terminal output (usually <code>[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)</code> or <code>[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)</code>). Visit this address in your browser to see your changes instantly. To stop the server, press <code>ctrl c</code> in the terminal.

!!! warning "If you run <code>duty</code> commands <b>without activating</b> the virtual environment (<code>venv</code>), the application won't start. Correct command: <code>source venv/bin/activate</code> (Linux/Mac). Wrong: <code>source venv/bin/active</code> (should end with "activate")."

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Making Changes (Example)

For example, let's add a small line to the <code>README.md</code> file:

```markdown
This line is an example of a commit made from a branch. üöÄ
```

To open in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

Don't forget to edit and save the file. If the local server is running (livereload), the page will automatically refresh.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Check Changes

What has changed?

```bash
git status
```

To see line-by-line differences:

```bash
git diff
```

Green shows new additions, red shows deletions.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare and Sign Commit (GPG -S)

Stage your changes:

```bash
git add .
# or for single file: git add README.md
```

Make signed commit:

```bash
git commit -S -m "README.md: added example line"
```

!!! tip "A good commit message is short and clear. Bad: <code>update</code>. Good: <code>docs: added contribution flow to README.md</code>."

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Push Your Branch to Remote

Now you can send your branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin my-branch
```

Example:

```bash
git push -u origin friend-landing-update
```

The <code>-u</code> parameter makes branch tracking easier for subsequent push/pull commands.

---

## üîü Open Pull Request (PR): Always PR!

Go to the repo page in browser: <code>[https://github.com/yuceltoluyag/yuceltoluyag.github.io](https://github.com/yuceltoluyag/yuceltoluyag.github.io)</code>

GitHub usually shows a "Compare & pull request" button. Click it and create your PR. In the description area:

- Explain <b>what</b> you did
- Explain <b>why</b> you did it
- Explain how to <b>test</b> it

briefly. For this repository, <b>we always open PR</b> for 2nd and subsequent works; this way there's no confusion with the repo owner, code review flow is maintained.

!!! note "In this project, don't push directly to the main branch. All contributions should come via <b>branch ‚Üí PR</b> flow."

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Check on GitHub

After opening the PR, you can see your commits and changes in the GitHub interface.
If GPG signature is correct, you'll see a <b>Verified</b> tag next to the commit.

!!! note "The GPG signature verifies that the commit truly belongs to you and provides security in team work."

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Second and Subsequent Work Sessions (Repeating Flow)

When you open the project again, <b>always apply</b> these steps:

```bash
cd yuceltoluyag.github.io

# 1) Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2) Update project tasks/dependencies
duty update

# 3) Open in editor (optional)
code .

# 4) Start local server (live reload)
duty livereload
```

> Why again and again? Because if the virtual environment isn't activated before starting, **the application won't start**. Also <code>duty update</code> keeps tasks/dependencies up to date.

**Recommended flow** for a **new work/feature**:

```bash
# Update main branch:
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create new branch:
git checkout -b task-short-name

# Work, commit, push:
git add .
git commit -S -m "feat: added X feature"
git push -u origin task-short-name

# Always open PR:
# GitHub -> Compare & pull request
```

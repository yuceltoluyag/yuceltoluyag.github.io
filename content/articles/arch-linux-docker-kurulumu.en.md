**Docker** is one of the indispensable tools in the modern software development and distribution world.
So, **how to install and configure Docker on Arch Linux?** In this guide, you will learn both **installation steps** and **basic usage tips** step by step.

With Docker, you can run your applications in isolated **container** environments, eliminate dependency chaos, and speed up your development processes.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Docker and Why is it Used?

Docker allows you to run software in isolated environments called **containers**. This way:

- You can create software packages that **run the same way** on different systems.
- You eliminate **dependency issues**.
- You ensure **consistency** across development, testing, and production environments.
- You gain fast installation and deployment capabilities.

For example, you can run a web application developed with PHP using Docker with **a single command** on both your own computer and the server.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Installation on Arch Linux

Arch Linux, thanks to its **rolling release** structure, always adds the latest Docker version to AUR or its official repositories.
Follow the steps below for installation:

### 2.1 Update Required Packages

Open your terminal and update your system packages:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

> üí° _Keeping the system up-to-date prevents potential dependency issues._

### 2.2 Install Docker Package

The `docker` package is available in Arch Linux's official repository:

```bash
sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose docker-buildx
```

### 2.3 Enable Docker Service

To automatically start Docker after installation:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker.service
sudo systemctl status docker.service
sudo systemctl is-active docker.service

```

> üö¶ _The `enable` command automatically starts Docker every time you open the system._

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ User Authorization (Sudo-less Docker Usage)

By default, `sudo` is required to run Docker commands.
To run Docker commands with your own user account:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Then log out and log in again or:

```bash
newgrp docker
```

This way:

```bash
docker ps
```

You can use the command without typing **sudo**.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Docker Installation

To test if the installation was successful:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This command:

- Downloads a small test image from the internet.
- Runs it in a container.
- Shows whether the installation was successful with terminal output.

On a successful installation, you should see output like this:

```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Docker Commands üõ†

Basic commands you need to know to start using Docker:

| Command               | Description                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `docker ps`           | Lists running containers        |
| `docker images`       | Lists existing images           |
| `docker pull <image>` | Downloads image from Docker Hub |
| `docker run <image>`  | Runs a new container            |
| `docker stop <id>`    | Stops the container             |
| `docker rm <id>`      | Deletes the container           |
| `docker rmi <image>`  | Deletes the image               |

üö® **The End of a Journey: Farewell to Rise of Kingdom Bot** üö®

Hello everyone,

Writing this article is not easy for me at all. However, it's time to share an inevitable truth: **I can no longer continue developing Rise of Kingdom Bot.**

There are two major reasons for this decision:

üë∂ **New Chapter in My Life:** I recently became a parent and now I spend most of my time with my little one. He's currently teething and parents know, during this period he can be quite fussy and noisy. üòÖ

üíª **Technical Barriers:** My current computer can no longer handle modern games and emulators. The FPS drops are so severe that testing the game has become almost impossible. Even when recording videos for YouTube, I had to struggle for hours to get 25-30 FPS. However, with the latest game and emulator updates, the situation has gotten even worse. FPS nearly drops to zero when rendering graphics and no optimization can fix this. ü•∂

Actually, I was quite enthusiastic about **designing a new GUI and adding new features**. However, when the testing process became this difficult, it bothered me that I couldn't offer something sufficiently stable and reliable to users. **Since I didn't want to share an incomplete or faulty work, I decided to abandon the project.**

!!! tip "Goodbye ThinkPad, Shortly after this process, I bought a new computer and said goodbye to my ThinkPad. üòÑ"

## How Did I Start?

I don't play this game because it has a **pay-to-win (P2W)** system. I'm not against spending money on games; after all, this is an entertainment industry and if you're having fun, spending money is entirely your choice. However, when a friend asked me if I could develop a bot, I decided to do a little research on the internet. Many cheating contents came up. Later I found an open-source bot and started working on it. However, the project's development slowed down after a while. I fixed some emerging errors, but then I put the project on hold.

After the intense interest following the video I shared on YouTube, I created a repository and started updating the code and adding new features as much as I could. So why am I telling all this? Because I'm not an expert on this game, I only had basic knowledge.

Over time, I started playing to better understand the game and progressed from the beginning to the conquest season. I spent money throughout this period, but when I reached the conquest season, I realized that almost none of my expenditures had any meaning. **In this game, it's not enough to just spend money, you also need to be as rich as Warren Buffett.** If you're not a big "whale" (high-spending player) or "kraken", just like in real life, you're a worker in the game. You can't fight on the front lines, you can only send soldiers to the garrison or stay behind the scenes of battles.

Even if you go to **C-D seeds** known as dead kingdoms, there are always players who have spent a lot of money but haven't learned the game and they still don't give you a chance. **You can never fight someone equal to your own strength.** You can't get golden heads from the strongest Governor, and even if your kingdom is poor, you won't be included in events. I didn't experience all this but my activity period was high. I started playing with 1 main character and 6 farm accounts. I spent most of my day on this game and **I was seriously becoming antisocial.**

If you pay attention, in large kingdoms **there are only 50 to 150 active players who spend serious money.** That is, **Free-to-Play (F2P)** players are only used to provide extra power in battles. I could write pages about this topic but you'd probably get bored. **In short, this game is not just pay-to-win; it's its god!**

## I've already spent 1 year understanding this game.

I want to share a quote from **Logic Bank**, whom I love very much and who is known as the "god" of F2P players:

<blockquote>
    <p>In other games, you work hard to be a good player, improve yourself and earn money in the esports community. But in this game, the one with the most money wins‚Äîeven in their tournaments.</p>
    <cite>Logic Bank</cite>

## Can I Earn Money by Farming?

The most important thing in this game is undoubtedly **resources**. **Even if you're a whale or kraken, you still need resources.** Due to Lilith Games' exaggerated pricing policy, even the richest players have to look for alternative ways.

When I started the game, everyone could sell resources as they wished and competition was quite high. Although Lilith Games claims to have banned this situation, trade still continues. However, now **kingdoms have stepped in** to stop this freedom. Now each kingdom has its own **official RSS (resource) sellers** and they don't trade with anyone outside of them.

If you catch a king's eye, your chances of making money increase. Otherwise, you need to work quite hard.

## Wake Up Call üö®

I know there are people who demanded some features from me for this project and later added them to their own **paid** bots they sold. I receive many messages about this. **Probably that's why Dylan Zheng also abandoned the project.**

People want to use you like a slave; with zero support, they only bother you for their own interests. Support doesn't necessarily have to be money‚Äî**YouTube subscription, following social media accounts, starring the project on GitHub etc.** small gestures are also important for community support. However, most people are only after a free alternative and don't contribute at all.

### Why Am I Abandoning This Project? üöÄ

While developing this project and examining other bots, I realized that people actually only want a "free" alternative. Because other bots in the market are really expensive and require weekly subscriptions. Bots focusing only on farming are cheaper, but I have no idea how reliable the seller is.

That's why I don't want to continue the project. Also, this game doesn't make me feel like I'm actually playing a game. **There's no one encouraging me to play nor do people provide support for enthusiasm.**

My videos on YouTube currently have approximately **30 thousand views**, but my subscriber count is quite low. People don't help with support at all, they're only looking for a free alternative. Now I understand much better why the original developer abandoned this project. **Rip @Dylan-Zheng**

### Legal Warning and Final Thoughts

I recently received a **legal warning from the Rise of Kingdoms team** (not to develop the bot). I only continued developing for educational purposes, but I guess after the last two commits they thought I was still active. üôÇ

So I'm sorry, I was only updating to keep my promise, but I guess we hit a wall. üòÖ **I recommend friends who forked the project and continue developing to be careful:**

Thank you for everything. üôè

Stay with love,

I received too many emails and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yuceltoluyag/){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} messages. All details about the project are available at the link.

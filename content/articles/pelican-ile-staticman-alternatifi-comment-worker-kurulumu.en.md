## Static Comment System with Pelican: comment-worker Installation ‚ú®

Dynamic comment systems have always been a problem for developers using static blog infrastructure. In this article, we will explain in detail how to integrate a comment system into a **Pelican** based blog using **comment-worker**, developed as an alternative to **Staticman**. ‚ú®

## What is comment-worker? üßµ

`comment-worker` is a modern comment infrastructure solution that runs on Cloudflare Workers and pushes user comments to platforms like GitHub or GitLab as JSON files. It is a secure and sustainable way to add dynamic content to static sites.

### Key Features

- ‚ú® **Staticman API compatibility** allows existing forms to be easily adapted.
- ‚ö° Fast and global access with **Cloudflare Workers** infrastructure.
- üì¶ Store comments in a version-controlled and transparent way with **GitHub/GitLab** integration.
- üîí Secure data exchange with new security improvements.
- üß† Easy configuration and flexibility with modern architecture.

## Why comment-worker Instead of Staticman? ü§î

- Staticman hasn't been updated for a long time (3+ years).
- Heroku's free plan was removed, making hosting expensive.
- comment-worker can be easily deployed with free platforms like Cloudflare Worker or Google App Script.
- The code was rewritten and made compatible with the `staticman.yml` file.

### Technical Improvements Made üõ†Ô∏è

- Both form and API requests supporting `application/json` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content types have been made compatible.
- Support for transformation with algorithms like SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 using WebCrypto has been added.
- `allowedOrigins`, now defined as a Worker environment variable (CW_ALLOWED_ORIGINS) instead of in `staticman.yml`.
- Simpler endpoint structure: organization, repo and branch information no longer in the URL.
- `pullRequestBody` properly handles multi-line text and includes placeholder support.
- Identities are now generated with `cuid2`.
- Zod is used for input validation and data transformations.

!!! note "Missing Features ‚ö†Ô∏è Features not yet available: documentation, tests, JSON/frontmatter support, GitHub token auth, notifications, anti-spam, auth, generatedFields and OneDev/GitLab support. Comments now automatically include a `date` field."

## Installation Steps üìÜ

### 1. Creating Cloudflare Worker

Log in to your Cloudflare account, create a new Worker and deploy the `comment-worker` code:

üëâ [Deploy to Cloudflare Now](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/smooshy/comment-worker){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

!!! warning "Error Case ‚ö†Ô∏è If you get an error, you can copy the src, package.json and wrangler.toml files from the created repository and deploy again."

To test locally:

```bash
wrangler dev
```

### 2. Installing GitHub Application

- Create a new application from the [GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/apps){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} page
- Define the following permissions:
  - **Contents**: read & write
  - **Pull requests**: read & write

### 3. Setting Environment Variables

Add the following information from the Cloudflare Workers Settings section:

| key                      | example                                                  | description                 |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| GITHUB_APP_ID            | 123456                                                   | GitHub Application ID       |
| GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY   | -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----...                           | GitHub Private Key          |
| GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_SLUG | github username                                          | Organization or username    |
| GITHUB_REPOSITORY_SLUG   | yuceltoluyag.github.io                                   | Repository to push comments |
| GITHUB_REPOSITORY_BRANCH | main                                                     | Target branch               |
| CW_ALLOWED_ORIGINS       | https://example.com, https://www.example.com             | CORS whitelist              |
| CW_DEBUG                 | true / false                                             | Debug mode                  |
| TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY     | https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/ | Im Not Human : )            |

!!! note "Debug Mode CW_DEBUG should be set to true initially. This way you can easily see the problems."

Don't forget to define the same env variables in the Build settings:

#### Converting Private Key to PKCS8 Format üîê

```bash
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in private-key.pem -out private-key-pkcs8.key
```

### 4. Adding staticman.yml File üìÑ

Add a `staticman.yml` file to the repository root directory as follows:

```yaml
comments:
  allowedFields: [name, email, message]
  branch: main
  filename: "comment-:year:month:day-:slug"
  format: "yaml"
  moderation: true
  path: "data/comments/{options.slug}"
```

### 5. Add Comment Form to Your Pelican Theme ‚úèÔ∏è

```html
<form
  submit="https://your-worker-subdomain.workers.dev/api/handle/form"
  method="POST"
>
  <div>
    <label for="fields[name]">Name</label>
    <input type="text" name="fields[name]" value="John Doe" required>
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="fields[email]">Email</label>
    <input type="email" name="fields[email]" value="" required>
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="options[url]">Website</label>
    <input type="url" name="options[url]" placeholder="https://example.com">
  <div>
    <label for="fields[message]">Message</label>
    <textarea name="fields[message]" required>Hello world!</textarea>
  </div>
  <div style="display: none">
    <label for="fields[slug]">Slug</label>
    <input type="text" name="fields[slug]" value="your/page/slug" readonly>
  </div>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  <button type="reset">Reset</button>
</form>
```

### 6. Specifying Content Type in API Requests

There's an important point to note when sending data to the API. The system accepts two different formats:

- **Form data format** (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)
- The format you're familiar with from HTML forms
- Data is sent as `name=value&other=another value`
- Example: `username=ahmet&password=123456`
- **JSON format** (`application/json`)
- Data is sent as an object
- Example: `{"username": "ahmet", "password": "123456"}`

**Important**: No matter which format you use, you must specify this in the `Content-Type` header of your request. The API doesn't automatically detect the data format. You must explicitly specify the format you're using.

### Sample Request

```json
POST /api/endpoint HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{"username": "ahmet", "password": "123456"}
```

Or with the other format:

```json
POST /api/endpoint HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=ahmet&password=123456
```

If you don't pay attention to this rule when sending your request, the API will most likely give errors.

```json
{
  "fields": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "message": "Hello world!",
    "slug": "your/page/slug"
  },
  "options": {
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```

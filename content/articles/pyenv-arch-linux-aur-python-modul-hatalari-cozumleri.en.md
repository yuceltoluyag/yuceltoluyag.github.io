Python development environments made easier by **pyenv** can cause some problems when installing AUR packages on Arch Linux. Especially when you change the system Python version with the `pyenv global` command, you are likely to get missing module errors in Python packages you are trying to install from AUR.

So why do these errors occur? And how can you solve them quickly? Let's examine these common Python module problems that occur when installing AUR packages with pyenv together.

---

## ⚠️ Source of the Problem: Pyenv and System Python Conflict

AUR helpers like `yay` or `paru` use the Python environment installed on the system when compiling packages. However:

- When you change the Python version with a command like `pyenv global 3.11.x`,
- The system Python environment is disabled,
- Some modules required for compiling packages (for example `build`, `installer`, `setuptools-scm`) may not be in the active version of pyenv.

As a result, you may encounter missing module warnings in `build()`, `package()` stages.

## 💥 Most Common Errors and Solution Suggestions

### 🔹 Error 1: `No module named build`

```bash
/home/user/.pyenv/versions/3.11.12/bin/python: No module named build
==> ERROR: A failure occurred in build().
```

**Solution:**
Run the following command in the terminal to install the missing module:

```bash
pip install build
```

---

### 🔹 Error 2: `Missing dependencies: setuptools-scm`

```bash
ERROR Missing dependencies:
    setuptools-scm
```

**Solution:**
Install the required module:

```bash
pip install setuptools-scm
```

---

### 🔹 Error 3: `No module named installer`

```bash
/home/user/.pyenv/versions/3.11.12/bin/python: No module named installer
==> ERROR: A failure occurred in package().
```

**Solution:**
Install the missing `installer` module:

```bash
pip install installer
```

---

## 🧰 Installing All Required Modules at Once

The following command quickly installs all the basic packages needed when installing Python packages from AUR:

```bash
pip install --upgrade build setuptools wheel setuptools-scm installer
```

---

## 🛠️ Alternative Solution: Temporary Return to System Python

If the Python version changed by pyenv is causing problems, you can temporarily use the system Python version when compiling AUR packages:

```bash
PYENV_VERSION=system yay -S package-name
```

This way, pyenv settings are temporarily disabled and the Python environment installed on the system is used.

## 🎯 Conclusion: Things to Consider When Installing Pyenv and AUR Packages

Although managing Python versions with `pyenv` is perfect for development, module deficiency errors can occur in AUR package managers because they expect the system Python environment on Arch Linux.

To overcome these problems:

* **Installing the required Python modules in the pyenv active version**
* **Compiling AUR packages with system Python if necessary**

will work. This way, you can have a trouble-free and fast installation experience. 😊

## 📋 Summary: Required Python Modules

| Module            | Description                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `build`          | For compiling packages       |
| `setuptools`     | Package configuration operations     |
| `wheel`          | Package production with `.whl` format |
| `setuptools-scm` | Version information management        |
| `installer`      | Installation of compiled package        |

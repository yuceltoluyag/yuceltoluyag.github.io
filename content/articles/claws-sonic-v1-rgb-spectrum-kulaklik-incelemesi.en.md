## 🎙️ Microphone Test and General Audio Performance

### 📢 Microphone Test Example

Below you can find a real audio recording to better understand the microphone performance of the headset. You can evaluate the microphone quality yourself:

<div class="audio-player">
  <audio controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/files/sestesti.opus" type="audio/ogg">
    Your browser doesn't support the audio element. <a href="/files/sestesti.opus">Click to download the audio recording</a>.
  </audio>
  <div class="audio-tip">
    <small>💡 You can use the three dots (⋮) menu on the player to change the playback speed.</small>

</div>

!!! tip "About the Audio Recording,At the time I shared this audio recording on Discord, I was using a laptop. The audio was a bit higher than normal then, but despite this, the microphone did quite well, I think it was more than successful."

!!! note "Noise Issue,As mentioned both in the article and in the audio recording, that noise was laptop-related. Currently I'm using a desktop computer and the microphone quality is exactly as I expected. If you have an older laptop, you might hear the sounds above—but know that there's more than what you're hearing. :D"

### 🔇 Low Frequencies

During our microphone test, we noticed a slight **low frequency** sound. However, this sound was not from the headset directly, but from the **sound card of the laptop we were using**. The microphone performance of the headset is generally sufficient.

### 🔒 External Sound Isolation and Ear Coverage

- The **large and closed design** of the headset allows it to completely wrap around the ear. This helps effectively isolate external sounds.
- For example; I barely heard a child crying at home. 🎧
- Even when not listening to music, external sound isolation is at a satisfactory level.

!!! tip "Note: Even if you have a large head, you can comfortably use the headset. As someone who has tried it, I say it's hard to find a bigger head than mine in Turkey! 😄"

## 🎵 Sound Quality: Strong Bass, Balanced Treble

- **Bass performance** is quite powerful and satisfying.
- In **treble sounds**, there is a slight harshness; however, this is not at a disturbing level.
- Considering the price range, it offers a sound quality that **more than meets expectations**.

---

## 🛋️ Comfort and Long-term Use

Regarding the comfort of the headset, the following can be said:

- It doesn't irritate the ear during long-term use.
- However, in **hot climates** (such as Adana, Hatay, Şanlıurfa, etc. 🌞), the pads may cause sweating.
- The pressure of the pads may cause slight discomfort for some users during long-term use.

---

## 🧠 AI-powered Noise Cancellation

The headset claims to have a **noise cancellation feature with artificial intelligence** without a software interface. In our tests:

- In a sound recording taken 1.5 meters away from the TV, during an open cartoon broadcast, a quite clean sound came out.
- This feature provides an effective experience especially during gaming or meetings. 🎮🗣️

## 🛠 Installation Steps

First, let's install the necessary tools using the commands below:

### Installing Terminator

```bash
sudo apt-get install terminator
```

**Terminator** allows you to use multiple terminal windows on the same screen. It provides great convenience especially for developers.

### Installing Fish Shell

```bash
sudo apt-get install fish
fish
```

When you switch to Fish, you can see that the icon has changed. To set Fish as the default shell:

```bash
chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
```

After this process, when you log out and log back in, Fish will be used as the default shell. 🐟

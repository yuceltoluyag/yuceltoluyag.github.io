## üîç Introduction

Installing custom ROMs on Android devices is a popular method to increase performance and get rid of manufacturer software restrictions. Especially on MediaTek-based devices like Redmi Note 8 Pro, this process requires some special steps. In this guide, we will explain step by step how to install custom ROM on Redmi Note 8 Pro on Arch Linux environment, how to protect your IMEI information and solutions to problems you may encounter. ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember, these operations may cause data loss on your device, so make sure you have backed up all your important data!

## üõ†Ô∏è Preparations

### Installing ADB and Fastboot

First, you need to install the necessary tools to communicate with your device. Open terminal on Arch Linux and run the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S android-tools
```

### Enabling USB Debugging

Make sure the **Settings > Developer Options > USB debugging** option is active on your device. To see developer options, you may need to tap **Settings > About Phone > Build Number** 7 times.

### Checking Device Connection

Connect your device to your computer via USB and run the following command in terminal:

```bash
adb devices
```

If your device appears in the list, the connection is successful. üü¢

## üíæ Taking IMEI Backup

!!! note "Important Taking IMEI backup is critical! If IMEI is lost while installing ROM, your device cannot find network."

### Learning IMEI Information

You can learn your IMEI number by running the following commands in terminal: [MediaTek IMEI Repair Guide](/mediatek-imei-onarma-rehberi/) is explained in detail here. It automatically backs up, but you can also take manual backup. It may be needed in the future.

```bash
adb shell
service call iphonesubinfo 1
exit
```

Alternatively:

```bash
adb shell dumpsys iphonesubinfo
```

Or:

```bash
adb shell getprop | grep imei
```

Sample output:

```
[ro.ril.miui.imei0]: [xxxxxxxxxx]
[ro.ril.miui.imei1]: [xxxxxxxxxxx]
```

> This only shows IMEI numbers. If you have dual SIM cards on your device, note down the IMEI numbers of both cards. This method does not apply patch process. Please use method 1.

### Taking NVRAM Backup (Root Required)

Taking NVRAM backup usually requires root access. If you don't have root access, you can backup by noting your IMEI numbers. You can examine the article at [MediaTek IMEI Repair Guide](/mediatek-imei-onarma-rehberi/) address.

## üîì Unlocking Bootloader

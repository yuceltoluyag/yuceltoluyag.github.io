## Fixing Steam Audio Errors on Arch Linux

🎮 Are you getting a "Could not initialize the sound engine" error in Steam games while using **Arch Linux** under Wayland? Don't worry — this guide will explain to you all the necessary steps to solve audio issues, step by step!

These types of errors usually stem from configuration issues related to **PipeWire**, **PulseAudio**, or the game's own audio engines. Now let's examine together how to solve these problems. 👇

English errors:

- Could not initialize the sound engine. Please make sure you have the latest audio drivers installed.

> "Ocam no problems with different games in Steam. When I say Tannenberg or Verdun, the screen opens but 'sound engine could not be started'. Otherwise I have sound in the system, there's no sound at all in these two games \:D"

!!! warning "Important Note We solved the problem in this guide by introducing the extensions, i.e. by applying the steps in number 3. Therefore, we removed the other startup options. However, I continue to leave extra information for users who can't solve the problem with this method. If you experience confusion, first apply the steps in the guide. If it doesn't work, you can try the other alternative steps."

## 1. Check PipeWire Configuration

### 1.1 Check the Status of PipeWire Services

Check if these packages are installed:

```bash
sudo pacman -S \
  alsa-card-profiles alsa-plugins alsa-ucm-conf \
  alsa-lib alsa-topology-conf alsa-utils \
  pipewire pipewire-audio pipewire-alsa pipewire-jack \
  pipewire-pulse pipewire-libcamera pwvucontrol \
  wireplumber lib32-pipewire lib32-libpulse
```

First, make sure PipeWire services are active and running properly on your system:

```bash
systemctl --user status pipewire
systemctl --user status pipewire-pulse
```

If the services are not running, use the following commands to enable them:

```bash
systemctl --user enable pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber
```

### 1.2 Enable PipeWire-Pulse Service

The `pipewire-pulse` service is required for Steam to work with audio systems. Check with the following command:

```bash
systemctl --user status pipewire-pulse
```

If the service is not running, apply the following command:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now pipewire-pulse
```

Also, installing the following package may be critical:

```bash
sudo pacman -S lib32-libpulse
```

---

## 2. Update Steam Launch Options

Another source of audio issues in Wayland environment could be SDL and graphics backend configurations.

## System Information and GPU Drivers

Galip's system:

- **Desktop environment:** KDE Wayland
- **Graphics card:** AMD Radeon RX 550

The following packages should be installed on AMD systems:

```bash
sudo pacman -S mesa lib32-mesa vulkan-radeon lib32-vulkan-radeon vulkan-tools
```

`vulkaninfo` output was as follows:

```bash
GPU id = 0 (AMD Radeon RX 550 / 550 Series (RADV POLARIS12))
```

> **Note:** These codes are for wayland startup options. You don't need to do it for X11. After these commands our problem was not solved, but I'm leaving it as information. Since it didn't work, we delete the startup options and continue.

## Steam Outputs and Errors

Some notable lines in Steam terminal outputs were:

```bash
ERROR: ld.so: object '.../gameoverlayrenderer.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (wrong ELF class): ignored.
(process:4678): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_object_unref: assertion 'G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed
```

Although these errors generally indicate graphics/system incompatibilities rather than audio, a bypass can be attempted via `LD_PRELOAD`.

## Solution 1: Game Launch Options

First, enter the following command in launch options in Steam:

```bash
env LD_PRELOAD="" %command%
```

If that doesn't work, try these variants:

```bash
env GDK_BACKEND=x11 SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11 LD_PRELOAD="" %command%
```

or

```bash
env PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pulse GDK_BACKEND=x11 SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11 LD_PRELOAD="" %command%
```

## Solution 2: Remove Overlay and XDG Portal

Steam Overlay can cause problems on some systems. Turn it off in settings.

Additionally, removing the `xdg-desktop-portals` package with the following command may be a solution:

```bash
sudo pacman -R xdg-desktop-portals
```

## Solution 3: Check PipeWire Service Status

```bash
systemctl --user status pipewire
systemctl --user status pipewire-pulse
```

Both should be in **active (running)** status.

Example output from Galip:

```bash
● pipewire.service - PipeWire Multimedia Service
     Active: active (running) since ...

● pipewire-pulse.service - PipeWire PulseAudio
     Active: active (running) since ...
```

### 2.1 Edit Launch Options in Steam

1. Right-click on game in Steam → **Properties**
2. Write the following in the **Launch Options** field:

```bash
env SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pulse GDK_BACKEND=x11 SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11 LD_PRELOAD="" %command%
```

This setting makes SDL use PulseAudio and run more stably via X11.

> **Note:** We couldn't solve the problem with these commands, we delete the launch options and continue.

## 3. Load Fmodstudio Libraries with LD_PRELOAD

Some games (e.g. **Isonzo**, **Verdun**, **Tannenberg**) may have errors due to special sound engines.

### 3.1 Find Game Folder

Right-click your game in Steam game library, select Browse Local Files from the Manage menu.
For me it looks like this:

```bash
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Isonzo/Isonzo/Isonzo_Data/Plugins
```

### 3.2 Add LD_PRELOAD to Launch Options

Launch options for each game should be set according to the following examples:

File content appears as follows:

```bash
Permissions  Size User     Date Modified Name
.rwxr-xr-x   13Mi friday13  5 May 04:50   libEOSSDK-Linux-Shipping.so
.rwxr-xr-x  2,9Mi friday13  5 May 04:50   libfmodstudio.so
.rwxr-xr-x  3,9Mi friday13  5 May 04:50   libfmodstudioL.so
.rwxr-xr-x  917Ki friday13  5 May 04:50   libresonanceaudio.so
.rwxr-xr-x  389Ki friday13  5 May 04:50   libsteam_api.so
```

#### Isonzo

```bash
LD_PRELOAD="$(pwd)/Isonzo/Isonzo_Data/Plugins/libfmodstudio.so $(pwd)/Isonzo/Isonzo_Data/Plugins/libfmodstudioL.so" %command%
```

#### Verdun

```bash
LD_PRELOAD="$(pwd)/Verdun/Verdun_Data/Plugins/libfmodstudio.so $(pwd)/Verdun/Verdun_Data/Plugins/libfmodstudioL.so" %command%
```

#### Tannenberg

```bash
LD_PRELOAD="$(pwd)/Tannenberg/Tannenberg_Data/Plugins/libfmodstudio.so $(pwd)/Tannenberg/Tannenberg_Data/Plugins/libfmodstudioL.so" %command%
```

## 4. Advanced Solution with GLIBC Tuning

If your glibc version is not 2.41 or higher, you may get audio errors in some games. In this case, glibc tunables setting can be helpful.

```bash
GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.rtld.execstack=2 %command%
```

This setting may make games work more compatibly with low-level audio managers on your system.

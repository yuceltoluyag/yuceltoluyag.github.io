Years of legendary music ðŸŽµ players **Winamp** and **AIMP** were indispensable for Windows users. However, **Audacious** became one of the best alternatives that offers a similar experience in Linux environment. After trying many MP3 players in the market, I chose Audacious because it offers the most customization.

Some may say "CMUS exists!", but I prefer Audacious in terms of visual appearance and ease of use. ðŸ˜Ž

## Introduction

Playing games on Linux has become much more accessible in recent years. However, **game localization** and **Turkish language support** are still not provided by default for every game. In this guide, we explain step by step how to install Turkish patches for games on Linux systems, especially for Arch Linux users.

Now, Turkish patch files with `.exe` extension are not only limited to games installed with Proton or Wine; with the correct directory structure, it's also possible to apply Turkish patches to **native Linux games**!

Let's get started if you're ready üéÆüáπüá∑

## 1. Requirements

Before proceeding to installation, the following components should be ready on your system:

- **Wine** ‚Äì To run Windows applications
- **Lutris** ‚Äì (Optional, but provides easy installation for many games)
- **Installed game files**
- **Turkish patch files** ‚Äì Usually in `.zip`, `.rar` or `.exe` format

---

## 2. Obtaining Turkish Patch Files

Turkish patches are prepared by volunteer translation teams and communities. It's recommended to download patch files from reliable sources.

üîó **Recommended Patch Sites:**

- [oyunceviri.net](https://www.oyunceviri.net/){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} ‚Äì The largest and active Turkish patch platform
- [sinnerclownceviri.net](https://sinnerclownceviri.net/){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} ‚Äì Translations especially for horror/adventure games
- [Donanƒ±m Haber Forum ‚Äì Published Patches](https://forum.donanimhaber.com/yayinlanmis-yamalar--f2632){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} ‚Äì Community-based archive

üìå **What to pay attention to when downloading:**

- Read comments and version information
- Make sure it's compatible with your game version
- Take a backup of your game folder if necessary

---

## 3. Opening `.exe` Format Installation Files

If the patch is presented as an installation wizard, you can easily run it through Wine:

```bash
wine setup.exe
```

When the installation screen opens, **manually specifying the game's installed directory** is important. Otherwise, the patch may install to the wrong folder.

## 4. Installing `.exe` Patches for Native Linux Games

Although `.exe` extension files seem to only work in Windows environments, the process these files perform is mostly copying files to specific folders.

Therefore, you can also install such patches in **native Linux games** that don't use Proton or Wine.

### üí° How does it work?

`.exe` extension patches usually perform the following operations:

- Add files to some folders of the game (`data`, `lang`, `resource`, `localization`)
- Overwrite existing files or create new folders

This process can be done manually on Linux:

```bash
# Example directory structure
~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/GameName/
```

Open the patch with Wine or a file manager and extract the contents to a temporary folder.

### üîß Installation Steps:

1. Run the `.exe` patch file with Wine or Bottles, or open it with tools like `Ark`, `file-roller`, `7z`
2. Extract the resulting files to a temporary folder like `~/Temp/patch/`
3. Identify folders like `data`, `lang`, `resource`, `localization` (case sensitive)
4. Copy the files to the corresponding locations in the game's Linux directory
5. Run the game and check that the localization has been successfully applied

## 5. Installation and Testing via Lutris

If you're running the game via **Lutris**:

- Lutris ‚Üí Right click the game ‚Üí **Configure** ‚Üí **Game Options**
- Check file paths and environment variables
- If necessary, manually direct the `run directory` field to the patched folder

Thanks to these settings, you can ensure the patch files are read correctly during the game.

| Problem                             | Possible Solution                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Game doesn't open after patch       | Change Wine version, restore from backup file                 |
| Turkish characters corrupted in menu| Missing font files may be the cause, try reinstalling patch   |
| `.exe` file doesn't open            | Install required DLL files with `winetricks`                  |
| Patch folders copied incorrectly    | Check directory structure and case sensitivity                |

## 7. Bonus: Automation Script (Advanced Level)

If you constantly install patches, you can automate the process with a simple bash script like below:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
unzip TurkishPatch.zip -d "$HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/GameName/"
echo "Patch installed successfully!"
```

üîê Note: Update the paths in the script according to your own system.

## Conclusion

Installing Turkish patches for games on Linux may seem complex at first, but it's quite simple once the basic principles are understood. Thanks to this guide, whether the game is installed with Wine or is a native Linux game, you can now enjoy playing your games in Turkish.

## Introduction

In some projects, instead of downloading the entire repository on GitHub, you may need **only a specific folder**.
For example, you might want to take only design files from a large project. In this guide, I'll show you step by step how to do this with the **Git Sparse Checkout** method ‚ö°

At the end of this guide:

- You'll be able to download only the folder you want,
- You'll save time and disk space by getting rid of unnecessary files,
- You'll be able to easily apply in Arch Linux and other Linux distributions.

# About Me

I'm told I was born in 1989, but since I couldn't consciously witness it, I approach it with a bit of skepticism. I have a strange feeling inside as if I've been living for centuries. Some who know me say I'm a sidewalk engineer, while others say I'm a developer. These are my bread and butter, of course; but my real profession is laziness. Too much detail is harmful to the system, so I'll end it here.

## What I Do

- 💻 Developing automation projects
- 📊 Data processing and analysis
- 🐧 Linux system administration
- 📝 Writing technical articles
- 🎥 Producing educational content

My interests include automation projects, data processing, and system administration.
When I find the time, I love to learn, try new things, and share what I've learned.

## Technologies

Some technologies I actively use:

- 🐍 Python & Django
- 🐧 Arch Linux
- 🐚 Shell Scripting
- 🐘 PHP (Laravel & CodeIgniter)
- 🗄️ PostgreSQL & MySQL
